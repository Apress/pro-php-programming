It is located on the N-A7, km 201, between Fuengirola, 10 minutes drive, and Marbella, 20 minutes away. It has retained it's fishing village charm with it's narrow streets and white-washed buildings and floral displays but it has developed in the last 20 years to become an important holiday destination, providing beautiful sandy beaches and a wealth of places to eat out in whether you are looking for restaurants, cafes or bars.<BR>There is a huge choice of restaurants, cafes and bars including Spanish, Thai, Indian, Chinese, English, Irish and Japanese within a few minutes walk. So you can have wine or beer with your meal without any worry about driving back to your hotel or apartment.<BR>Tapas, menu del dia [ meal of the day ], a la carte meals, chocolate y churros or just a sandwich are all available.A whole range of prices provide for your personal requirements.<BR>Many of the Spanish restaurants take an extended holiday in December and January but there is still plenty of choice.<BR>El Gusto Restaurant on the Bulevar de la Cala de Mijas, serves consistently high quality English-style food. Helen and Steve are most welcoming hosts. Food is cooked to order so couldn't be fresher. Sandwiches such as California Wrap with chicken, cheddar cheese, peppers, spinach, avocado, red onion and chilli jam costs 6.95 Euros and is a substantial meal. Mussels cooked in white wine, garlic and cream, served with crusty bread is a tasty light bite, as are the sardines, both at 5.95 Euros.A two course menu del dia costs 10.95 and provides, for example, home made soup and a fish course or a steak pie. The English-style breakfast will keep you satisfied well into the evening and is cooked to perfection.<BR>The terrace is the ideal place to sip your wine or beer or simply linger over a tasty cup of coffee.<BR>Next door is Biddy Mulligan's Irish Bar, which is also a popular meeting place. With new smoking laws introduced, customers are only allowed to smoke outside on the terraces, which most restaurants have. But the terraces are also very popular to soak up the sunny climate.<BR>A typical Spanish-owned restaurant is El Cortijillo Restaurant, owned by Alonso Arroyo Benitez and family. They are a delightful family who are most professional. It's an extremely popular restaurant with excellent quality meals. The jacket potato is the fluffiest I've eaten!<BR>The Cafe Boulevard is the Internet Cafe and Post Office. If you want to be surrounded by mostly English speaking people this cafe is a hive of activity. Both the computers and the post office facilities are used by all nationalities. Home made cakes and smoothies are as popular as wine and beers. Mid-morning coffee accompanied by a brandy is usual.<BR>The Churreria-Cafeteria Canon is on the same road as El Cortijillo and is again a Spanish restaurant. You can buy chocolate y churros, a popular morning ritual, of dipping doughnut-like sticks into thick drinking chocolate or choose a vast array of tapas. The restaurant fills up quickly at lunchtime when the local workers arrive for the menu del dia, usually a satisfying kind of meat casserole, naturally with a bottle of red wine. It is a great place to soak up the Spanish atmosphere.<BR>The Heladeria-Caeteria on the Calle Torreon, by the beach, again has an outside terrace, next to the Castle and serves a whole range of ice-creams or cakes and coffee.<BR>Also on the beach front is Restaurant Jose which serves a good paella. When you order paella it has to be for a minimum of 2 people.<BR>Further along the beach are the Arroyo-Chiringuito Bar and Los Delphines. Both serve a whole range of snacks, meals, coffees, beers and wine. The Arroyo Bar has it's own boat outside on the beach and barbecues sardines in it. There is a good fish soup on the menu at Los Delphines. The terrace is directly on the beach so you can sunbathe on the sands until you are thirsty or hungry and then walk a few steps to sit at a table and order a meal or a drink.<BR>There are several bars with large screen television for watching the live football matches. The Sports Bar, near the Cafe Boulevard, on the Centro Comercial La Cala Sol, has a television outside on the terrace. You can catch up on live horse racing too.<BR>The Chinese Restaurant, Great Wall, is open every day and also provides a take-away service. The meal of the day is 5.45 Euros for 4 courses.<BR>The New China Restaurant also provides a take away service.<BR>El Pikoteo, again Spanish, serves fish, meat and salads at good prices, around 6.50 Euros. There is a generous amount of food served on the plate.<BR>The Thai Royal Orchid Restaurant is a welcoming restaurant serving soups, salads, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, duck and seafood dishes. A typical beef dish is 11 Euros. Pork and chicken are slightly cheaper.<BR>Bombay to Goa and Sai Indian Restaurants are close by and again, serve good meals in a pleasant atmosphere.<BR>If you are looking for a more formal setting, then you could try the Cala Mijas Hotel Restaurant, just 10 minutes walk away. It is a working hotel and restaurant but is also a training hotel for potential hospitality employees. Service is slow but the meal is good, if a little expensive. You need to book.<BR>These are merely a handful of restaurants, cafes and bars available in La Cala de Mijas within walking distance. The sunny climate and the casual dress of customers allows you to relax totally. You will not be disappointed with both the choice and the quality of food when eating out. You will need to return for another holiday to sample all the ones you haven't yet had chance to visit.<BR>Happy Eating and Drinking!

Now think of Madeira as a travel destination and it's safe to say many will be seeing a nice elderly couple sharing stories and a packet of boiled sweets. <BR>Visit the island this year, however, and you're just as likely to meet the younger crowd emerging after dusk, sipping ponchas and enjoying the capital Funchal's nightlife. Then there's the group of trekkers on the island's burgeoning levada mountain trails. Or the thrill-seekers, paragliding and trying to figure out how they can stick a flag on one of the sheer cliffs, to claim them as their own. <BR>The older folk are also here in their thousands, enjoying all this activity, reminiscing with their 'In my day...' stories of yesteryear. They live cheek by jowl, and it's this amusing mix that is injecting Madeira with a new sense of adventure. <BR>Even landing at the island's airport is an extreme sport of sorts as the landing strip is partially built on stilts on the Atlantic Ocean floor, a fact that can only fully be appreciated by seeing it for yourself on terra firma. <BR>So soon after you land, it'd be sinful not to try a poncha. Served hot or cold, it's made from rum, honey and lemon juice, but beware. One local warned us that one poncha is okay, you'll be dancing after two, but after three, you'll be speaking fluent Portuguese. Boa sorte! <BR>Endearingly, those same locals are as proud as punch of their home. It's heart-warming to hear people talk about what they like about their 'upstairs' ? the lush mountainous areas overlooking Funchal, but they're house-proud too, giving out about a couple of high-rise developments 'downstairs', on the eastern outskirts of town. <BR>Funchal derives its name from the Portuguese word funcho (fennel). The herb was in abundance when the first settlers put down their roots, soon after Madeira was officially discovered in the early 15th century by Jo�o Gon�alves Zarco and Trist�o Vaz Teixeira, who were under the command of Prince Henry the Navigator. <BR>Fennel is still plentiful, as is almost every herb, fruit, vegetable and flower known to man (well, to this man anyway). There are a lot more than 40 shades of green on the island, with almost every square inch of land pleasingly cultivated in some way. This was a particular highlight, driving up steep hills, bananas just begging to be picked (we didn't, you shouldn't); and Strelitzia (birds of paradise) just looking at you, sizing you up, begging for you to put your finger in their 'mouths' (we did, we had kids to entertain). <BR>And if you can't drive, walk. For miles and miles, alongside the roads on the hills and mountains, there are mini canals called levadas, which in practical terms are used to transport water to the lowlands, but are increasingly becoming known as the non-speaking route guides which showcase the island's most breathtaking scenery. <BR>Back at sea level, Funchal is a captivating nook, full of gardens and parks, proper old churches and buildings, and classy restaurants aplenty. Eating out is good value and the choice is as broad as your palate will allow. Espetada (chunky beef rubbed in garlic and salt and served on a hanging skewer ? sounds rough and tough, but tastes delicious) is recommended, and on an island this size, it's not surprising that the fish is served so fresh, after the morning's catch. Espada (scabbard) is the island's speciality fish and is found on most menus. <BR>Like any popular destination, there is a choice of pizza and burger joints (most welcome for a meal on the run), right up to the 'destination' Michelin-starred Il Galo d'Oro restaurant in the Cliff Bay Hotel. Or perhaps you could dress up and take afternoon tea at Reid's Palace Hotel. If, like the queen of England, taking afternoon tea is your thing, good luck to you; we're assured Reid's put on a great spread. George Bernard Shaw and Winston Churchill were hotel fans. But at �28.50 per person, those scones had better be homemade. <BR>Of course, any meal should be toasted with Madeira wine. Blandy's is the most famous of the island's producers, and it has led the march to tempt the world's leading sommeliers for two centuries now. Tours of the Blandy's Wine Lodge in Funchal is a couple of hours well spent. <BR>Our favourite dining experience, however, was in our hotel restaurant. We stayed in the CS Madeira Atlantic Resort &amp; Spa, and it has five stars written all over it. Incredible value, delicious food and impeccable service, the CS is sure to build a fanbase through word of mouth. The view of the Atlantic from the hotel is stunning. It's built into a cliff at the start of the Lido area, a stroll west of Funchal. The Lido promenade is a relaxing place for a family to mosey, with playground cubbyholes, fun restaurants and incredible views. <BR>It is said that Funchal isn't ideal for families with small children, but we found it easy to navigate. Taxis are cheap, and even the smallest ones will love the open-top bus tour, if only for the welcome cool wind blowing in their faces. Open-tops may look naff ? it's tourism on wheels ? and of course they're only taking you to the parts of the town or city the authorities want you to see, but it's a great way to set out your stall for the rest of your stay. Get your bearings on one of these on the first couple of days, and everything slots into place more easily afterwards. <BR>It could be said that you travel 'through' Madeira, literally. Many of the mountains and hills are pockmarked with handy tunnels, giving some of the landscape the look of a block of Swiss cheese. Madeira's temperate year-round climate is one of the island's main selling points, and it's the reason winters can be busy. We visited in October, and Funchal was doing a brisk trade. The island is traditionally one of the first ports of call for cruiseliners on their maiden voyage, and the refurbished QEII paid a visit while we were there (the afternoon tea staff at Reid's were flat out). <BR>We took to the open seas on a pirate ship, manned by 'real pirates', according to our three-year-old, who was delighted with the parrots cawing her name. Although, in fairness to her, 'Ola, Ella' is quite funny, coming from a bird. On other trips, there's the chance to swim with dolphins and go whale-watching, and if you're a water activities enthusiast, Madeira won't disappoint. <BR>One downside is the absence of natural sandy beaches. There are a couple of manmade ones, with sand imported from Africa, but the otherwise rocky beaches will disappoint some. So if lying by the hotel pool (the CS Madeira has five, including two children's pools) just isn't enough, and you really need to add sand to the mix, a two-hour boat trip to Madeira's little sister island of Porto Santo will satisfy that urge. <BR>Now, Blandy's may be fortifying wine for 200 years, and Reid's have been brewing tea for a few decades short of that. But many still think of Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo as the island's most famous export. Old and new ? Madeira's story. The Portuguese archipelago has a landscape so lush it makes the Ireland look barren. This group of nine islands is a thousand miles west of Lisbon, and with its ancient volcano craters, lakes and opportunities for whale watching, it's a nature lover's paradise. Its lovely summer weather allows for various outdoor activities, including trekking, paragliding and golf. While you can fly directly from Dublin to the Azores, it is probably more cost effective to go via London. Visit Azores.com This small group of islands, 28 miles off the coast of Cornwall have been designated an area of outstanding beauty and it's not difficult to see why: crystal blue water, golden beaches and a decidedly tropical flora all combine to make it feel like your thousands of miles away, as opposed to relative neighbours.

32	\N	2011-01-30	http://www2.ljworld.com	During the winter months, I like to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I’m not much of a baker, but I do love to cook. I especially like to make recipes that are a reflection of my heritage. Not to mention, my family loves Italian food. <BR>I usually make a traditional spaghetti sauce, whether it’s a meat sauce or marinara. I use canned tomato sauce or canned plum tomatoes as the base and go from there. <BR>I had heard about San Marzano tomatoes, but never tried them. Originally, I thought they were a brand. I was wrong. They are a type of plum tomato originally grown in San Marzano, Italy. <BR>Not too long ago, I saw Rachael Ray make a stuffed meatball recipe with a sauce that called for San Marzano tomatoes. The recipe looked really good and seemed pretty easy. I headed to the grocery store with my list in hand, and went about purchasing the ingredients I needed. In my pantry, I always have canned tomatoes, but I was curious about these San Marzano tomatoes. Was there a difference in flavor? I was going to give them a try. <BR>I followed the recipe as listed using turkey sausage. I was anxious to try the sauce. The San Marzano tomatoes are slightly more expensive than traditional canned tomatoes, so I was curious to see if the cost difference was worth it. <BR>We all loved the finished results. There is definitely a flavor difference in this variety of tomato. It is a much richer tomato flavor. I have since switched over, especially when I’m making a marinara sauce. I just heat up some olive oil in my saucepan, add garlic, crushed San Marzanos (I use my potato masher to crush) and basil, salt and pepper to taste. Let that simmer for twenty to thirty minutes and you have a flavorful sauce. <BR>Now about the stuffed meatball recipe . . . like I said, my family loved it. Don’t overcook the meatballs. I was reading some of the reader reviews on foodnetwork.com, and there were a few comments that stated the meatballs had become slightly rubbery. I did not experience that. <BR>Mozzarella Stuffed Chicken Sausage Balls with Tomato-Basil Sauce, Cacio e Pepe Potatoes and Roast Broccolini <BR>Ingredients <BR>9-item grocery list: <BR>2 pounds baby Yukon gold potatoes 1 tub bocconcini, bite size fresh mozzarella in water 2 pounds Italian hot or sweet fresh chicken, turkey or pork sausage, bulk if available 1 1/2 pounds broccolini 1 head garlic 1 (28-ounce) can San Marzano tomatoes 1/2 cup chicken stock or milk 1 tub grated Pecorino Romano 1 tub good quality fresh pesto from the refrigerated cases of the market <BR>On hand: <BR>Extra-virgin olive oil, for liberal drizzling, 4 to 5 tablespoons total Salt and freshly ground black pepper <BR>Directions <BR>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. <BR>Quarter baby potatoes and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil then salt water and cook until tender, about 12 minutes. <BR>While potatoes come up to a boil, place a nonstick baking sheet alongside a mixing bowl. Remove 12 pieces of bite sized mozzarella from the water and set on work surface. Remove sausages from casings, if bulk not available, and place in a bowl. Combine the meat into a single mound then score it into 4 sections. Each section will yield 3 large sausage meatballs. To form each ball, take a handful of meat and wrap it around a piece of mozzarella. Roll 12 balls. Wash up. Coat balls with a drizzle of olive oil. Bake 18 to 20 minutes until cooked through and evenly browned. <BR>While the balls are cooking, trim ends of clean broccolini and scatter evenly over a baking sheet. Grate or chop 2 to 3 cloves of garlic and drizzle the broccolini and garlic with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper and roast 12 to 15 minutes to crisp the broccolini tops. <BR>While the broccolini is roasting, add tomatoes to a small pot or skillet, mash with a potato masher and season with salt and pepper. Heat over medium heat then simmer to reduce about 8 to 10 minutes. <BR>When the potatoes are tender, drain and return to the hot pot to dry them out a little. Mash the potatoes with 1/2 cup stock or milk, 1/2 to 2/3 cup grated Romano cheese, a few generous handfuls, lots of black pepper and a little salt. <BR>Turn the heat off the tomatoes and stir in 1/2 cup prepared pesto. <BR>Serve three cheese-stuffed sausage balls with tomato-basil sauce on top or underneath, cacio e pepe smashed potatoes and broccolini alongside.

Seeing all the hole-in-the-wall eateries serving up their mama’s pasta recipes made him realise he could do the same thing – using his own rich culinary heritage as a starting point.<BR>The place has indoor space for about 28 covers and a few extra for the smokers on the pavement. <BR>Sporting one cerise pink wall and one turquoise, the place has a suitably sparkly Cape Carnival outfit (donated by Mr Daniels, whom patrons can see smiling down at them in a photo) on one wall.<BR>Nearby, a cluster of photos from the owner’s childhood reinforce the homely atmosphere, while on another wall panama hats hang in rows and a large mirror gives a sense of depth to the small eatery. <BR>On shelves here and there are a collection of vintage teapots and Swartland-Gorlei’s i-Pod shuffles through the decades and genres, adding to the ambience.While we soaked up the atmosphere, Swartland-Gorlei served samoosas. <BR>Light and crispy, filled with spicy mince and mashed potato they are worth the trip on their own. <BR>Next up was tomato bredie, which released swirls of cinnamon as we lifted the lid, and smoor snoek, a spicy fish dish that captures its Cape Malay roots in every mouthful.<BR>Served with a bowl of steamed rice, we couldn’t finish our generous portions as we simply had to save space for the milk tart. <BR>Encased in phyllo pastry, it is the best milk tart I have ever had: firm, creamy and not too sweet, it is heaven in a slice.<BR>I will be going back soon for the cheese cake, another of the proprietor’s show?stoppers.<BR>The food is served in a hotch-potch of crockery, all of which has a "borrowed from granny’s kitchen" feel to it, and it too adds to District Six’s feel of home and sense of history. There are also pickles on sale that Swartland-Gorlei makes himself.<BR>The one thing that does not remain constant at District Six is the menu. <BR>Swartland-Gorlei cooks what he likes every day and changes the menu accordingly. <BR>With fewer than 10 items on the menu, patrons run the risk of not getting the bobotie they are craving if it’s sold out before they arrive, but if you call ahead the owner will set aside your choice – so long as it’s on that day’s menu.<BR>Also, Swartland-Gorlei is delighted to fill one of your casserole dishes with one of his home-cooked treats. <BR>If you fancy oxtail for dinner or perhaps prawn curry, so long as you give him enough notice, he will make it for you and you can pick it up later.<BR>District Six is just like home, except someone else is doing the cooking.<BR>»District Six Eatery in Emmarentia in Joburg is open Tuesday to Saturday for lunch and dinner.<BR>011 486 7226.
35	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.thestandard.co.zw	I’VE knocked around a fair bit of this funny old world over three-score-years and four and don’t think I’ve ever been in any country where St Valentine’s Day is taken more seriously than here in Zimbabwe. <BR>This is surely paradoxical, as I’m pretty certain we’re also in the top three countries for divorce! <BR>Check Dusty’s What’s On Diary (below left) and there’s Valentine’s events listed at various hotels, clubs, pubs and restaurants from February 12 to February 18, although the actual feast of lovers (pass the sick-bag, please!) is — most inconveniently — on Monday February 14. <BR>I say “most inconveniently” because Monday’s not a great night to take out the love of your life (or The Missus!). Far better the actual day falls over a weekend. <BR>I’ll be on my way back from an eight-day luxury cruise on Brilliance of the Seas in the Persian Gulf on the 14th, flying somewhere between Dubai-Addis Ababa and Ha-ha-ha-rare (Africa’s fun capital) by Ethiopian Airways. <BR>So I won’t be faced with the harrowing choice of which fragrant, pouting lovely I’ll shower in red roses, chocolates, teddy bears, champagne, expensive perfume and entertain for dinner! (If you believe that, you’ll credit anything!) <BR>Almost every outlet in the country worth its table salt will offer a “special” menu on that day and I was fortunate enough to be invited to Meikles Hotel’s discreetly tucked away Livingstone Room on Tuesday to sample executive chef Chris Gonzo’s proposed menu at a chef’s table laid on for the specialist Press. <BR>Oysters have, shall we say, reputedly aphrodisiacal properties (but last time I ate a dozen, only 10 worked!) and Chef Gonzo starts a Valentine menu with a seafood platter of freshly-flown in from Scotland large, juicy, “oysters” (well, one!), accompanied by prawn-and-pineapple skewer and Scottish mussels steamed in white wine with a gratinated chorizo crumb. This went beautifully with a still warm in-house baked brown roll and butter. <BR>One of our number was allergic to seafood (shame, eh? ...more for greedy me, though!)  and the kitchen quickly knocked up carpaccio of beef with capers and gratinated parmesan cheese as a replacement dish.) <BR>Then there was a good-sized “marriage” of spinach-and-tomato soup, served steaming hot in a coffee cup: deep, intensive, herby flavours and full of vegetarian goodness. <BR>Following this we had an attractive retro (very retro: Victorian/Edwardian) palate-cleansing chilled watermelon and mint sorbet, I found sophisticated and refreshingly different. <BR>There’s a choice of two magnificent main courses and I was torn between what looked a handsome helping of dill-scented salmon (I suspect flown in from Scotland along with the oysters, mussels and scallops with which the country’s major restaurants are currently awash, but provenance unstated) with saffron mashed potatoes, steamed fine beans and tarragon-white wine and — mustard sauce) and the dish I finally plumped for. <BR>This was prime rack of deliciously slow-cooked lamb cooked in rosemary and mint, served with “turned” potatoes (looked and tasted like roast to me), butternut puree and a rich lamb “jus” (gravy to you!) <BR>The pudding was hedonistically, decadently rich (and totally scrumptious): chocolate-and-ora- <BR>nge stack (layers of Tia Maria chocolate sponge and light orange mousse served with sharply tart frozen raspberries and whipped cream). <BR>I wasn’t sure I relished the sound of the cheese course: French Camembert drizzled with golden honey. I enjoy both items tremendously but was dubious about wedding them together). It worked well. The cheese portion was generous, honey subtle, by no means overpowering, the dish served with wafers, pecan nuts and plump purple grapes. <BR>We finished with coffee and petite-fours. <BR>On St Valentine’s Day this wonderful gourmet spread will set you back US$40 apiece in the La Fontaine Restaurant, with dancing to the resident band, or in the specially re-opened for the occasion Bagatelle Restaurant of fond, nostalgic memory, with a cabaret by young local crooner Josh Ainslie. <BR>There’s a special deal on accommodation, including honeymoon suites but I feel that anyone who can thoroughly and energetically use the principal item of furniture therein for its design purpose, after ploughing through Chef Gonzo’s masterpiece creations, deserves the Pope’s Special Award for Services to Procreation! <BR>This will be a sell out, I suggest you book early. <BR>This e-mail address is being protected from spambots.

36	Richard Fox	2011-01-30	http://www.suite101.com	Cuisine ? la Bire If you think starts and ends with left-over lager in your fish batter, or a slug of stale stout in the stew, then youre in for a rather pleasant surprise. Regard in similar terms to having an orchestra at your disposal to accompany your daily whistles and hums a little French horn as you stride down the street, a spot of soothing viola as you muse in the caf, and a good dose of thumping tympani for those big bathroom power notes. While for the average person that concept would be both expensive and impractical the world of beer cheffery is a cheap and easy alternative and offers at the very least, an equal amount of sensory pleasure. And just in case youre thinking that Ive been dipping into the barrel one time too many and gone hopping mad lets remember it was that legendary nineteenth century gastronaught, Auguste Escoffier, who rubber stamped the old amber nectar as a legitimate gourmet ingredient - with the term: Cuisine `a la Bire. Now you cant ask for more top-end endorsement than that.<BR>While we are all familiar with the idea of using wine in our cooking, there are some fundamental differences in the principals of utilising beer. Firstly, wine is generally added only at the beginning of the culinary process. It gives a little balancing acidity to a cream or butter sauce; a tannic, fruity element to a slow cooked casserole, or a tenderizing, flavour-enhancing function when used as a marinade. Wine can also be reduced i.e. boiling off the water content to concentrate flavour. This should be avoided with beers with any significant hop or bitter character, as it just concentrates that bitterness into something of toe-curling palatability. And while, the concept of cooking wine is anathema to any chef worth their salt - the depths and varieties of flavour within artisan beers will have a far greater effect on the finished dish than wines more subtle impact. This is not to put wine down I love it on the right occasion to accompany my food; chilling with an aromatic Tokai and a loved one is hard to beat, while as a classically trained chef, Im always going to have a decent bottle of crisp, dry Sauvignon Blanc to hand for my beurre blanc reduction. But, the rules are more rigid, and the experiences are narrower. Beer lets you freestyle when it comes to cooking; it opens doorways, frees the spirit, and challenges the mind. It gives the novice a chance to shine, while the pro can really push the envelope of creativity. Bottom line is: wine gives you the chamber orchestra; beer the full blown symphony.<BR>A good mixed case of artisan beers is a Pandoras Box of aromas, flavours and textures to make the most basic ingredient sing and dance on your palate. There are, quite literally, as many different beer flavours as there are food flavours. Take into account the chemistry of beer i.e. relative acidity and alcohol, and youve got a recipe ingredient as adaptable and diverse as the ubiquitous chickens egg. Think of a cooking method and theres a type of beer that can be incorporated into it slow roast, braise, poach, steam and saut. Think salad dressings, marinades, chocolate desserts, iced deserts, parfaits, pts - even sushi and Szechwan. For all these, and more, theres a specific brew, which will give a twist here and a lift there. And the great thing is; theres nothing complicated about it. Just combine the smallest amount of common sense with an adventurous spirit and youre away. Before we get into specifics however, lets dispel a few myths about cooking with alcohol per se. Firstly, referencing back to the cooking wine concept, the quality of the finished dish is a reflection of the quality of the ingredients used. So, the idea of using only cheap booze for cooking is fundamentally flawed. Secondly, the idea that beer is purely a means of intoxication and when it comes to a real taste experience - well, thats best left to the wine lovers, is clearly hog wash. Look out for the fruit beers from the Lambic region of Belgium fermented by wild, airborne yeast, whose inherent sourness and real fruit make for the ultimate salad dressing ingredient, and a fruity base for a game sauce. Fragrant, citrusy wheat beers are marvellous marinades for fish, as well as a refreshing addition to the classic Italian Semi-Freddo. Play with balancing flavours such as the addition of something sweet - braising Fennel in Belgian wheat beer with a couple of tablespoons of honey and a squeeze of lemon juice is nothing short of orgasmic. To seal the deal, just reduce the cooking liquor to a syrup, pour over the fennel, sprinkle over fresh, grated Parmesan and grill Oh mama! While the Belgians may well provide the ultimate model for beer and food, we can find real inspiration on our own British doorstep. John Keenan, head brewer at Fullers brewery of Chiswick produces a fine range of classic and more experimental English ales. The dark and complex 1845 juicy, matly, and strong - is perfect for long slow cooking. Just make sure you have enough left over to serve with the Stilton. In fact, any great British artisan ale will compliment and contrast with all manner of great British cheeses youll just be left wondering how you ever contemplated anything else.<BR>So, to set you on your way, here are a variety of cooking methods and an idea of the beers to utilise for them. The variations that can be achieved within each category are endless - your imagination and time for experimentation are the only limiting factors. When it comes to Cuisine`a la Bire, dont be afraid to experiment: try different beers to the ones Ive suggested, and dont be afraid to make mistakes which can often turn into something more interesting and tasty anyway. Youll make your own unique discoveries and gain a catalogue of eureka moments to sustain you on those darkest, dreariest, old leftover veg days. Bon appetite, and Cheers! Its not just the cheaper, less tender cuts of red meat that love the treatment chicken, fish and lean pork lend themselves perfectly to the extra flavour punch of a good marinade. A strong, darker beer is perfect for rich red meats. Beer is also, allegedly, high in tenderising enzymes, making it ideal for tenderizing loving care. For fish - a zesty, herb-infused wheat beer such as the Belgian Hoegaarden or German Schneider Weisse is ideal. And dont forget to add your marinating liquors to the cooking vessel itself for maximum flavour.<BR>Full flavoured, strong beers such as a Belgian Trappist, or Abbey beer are perfect as are the fabulous range of strong English bottles beers such as Fullers ESB, Vintage ale and Timothy Taylors Landlord. The fruity characteristics of these ales just offer that extra depth of flavour to the finished dish that makes a winning difference.<BR>Try experimenting with different beers in bread dough. Just substitute a small amount of water for beer. For best results use a bottle-conditioned beer: These are the very best of the bottled beer genre, as they contain a live yeast sediment which continues to act on the beer after theyve been bottled. As far as cakes are concerned, try a chocolatey porter or stout in a fruitcake or Christmas pudding.<BR>Beer helps make fabulous batter. From dark, richly- flavoured fish batters to pale, feather-weight Tempuras, the spritzy carbonation boosts crisipness, and aids rising just try a slug of Yorkshire ale in a Yorkshire pudding batter to see what I mean.<BR>Beer is an ideal poaching liquor for savoury or sweet, adding so much more than just water. Figs and pears are good candidates for big fruity Belgian Abbey beers, while fish or chicken can be poached in a fragrant wheat beer with added coriander, lemon or lime juice.<BR>Steaming mussels in beer was a eureka moment in my early days of . Ive never done them in wine since!<BR>From a sweet caramelized onion gravy finished with a good slug of British bitter, to a reduced Lambic Framboise in a raspberry coulis and everything in between. Even a little Pilsner lager in creamy sauce with chicken can give an extra dimension to take it from the ordinary to the extraordinary.<BR>Beer is a marvellous addition to desserts from chocolatey Porters and creamy stouts to those Lambic fruit beers, its all about balance; comparing and contrasting flavours; cutting through richness and cleansing the palette. The bitter quality of a beer is the perfect foil for the sweetness of a rich chocolate tart, while Ice creams, fruit coulis and sweet sauces can all benefit from the addition of an appropriately flavoured beer.
37	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.articlesbase.com	We know that there are 3 major food groups: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Among these three, fat is the major source of energy for the body, since one gram of fat can provide 9 calories, as compared to one gram of carbohydrates or proteins, which can only provide 4 calories. Fat makes intestinal absorption of Vitamins A, D, E, K, and carotenoids possible. I bet everyone agrees that fat in the diet also provides taste and consistency of food and makes us feel full. However, we should be aware of the established risks that are associated with fats. As you will see, not all fats are commendable.<BR>It used to be that fats occur only either as saturated or unsaturated fats. Saturated fats have adequate hydrogens and they usually occur in solid form at room temperature. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, have missing hydrogens in their structure, so instead of solidifying at room temperature, they occur in liquid oil.<BR>Back in 1901, a German chemist named Wilhelm Normann showed that hydrogens could be added to liquid oils (unsaturated fats) turning them into sticky margarines (saturated fats) through a process called hydrogenation. His discovery made it possible for whale oils and fish oils before to be stabilized for longer periods. The fat industry realized that by turning liquid oils into solid form, for instance, turning soybean oil into margarine, allowed them to store more oils for a considerable period of time. It was also found that due to its chemical features, margarine, unlike butter, can be taken out of the refrigerator. Margarine also tend to be more spreadable on breads. Furthermore, hydrogenated fat provided superior baking properties than lard.<BR>Today, these chemically altered hydrogenated fats are known as "trans fat". Trans fats are manufactured commercially and can be found in vegetable shortening, some crackers, margarines, snack foods, baked products such as doughnuts and pastries, and foods made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils like fried chicken and french dried potatoes. They are neither essential nor beneficial to one's health. In fact, scientists have found out that consumption of trans fat (including saturated fats and dietary cholesterol) can build up "bad cholesterol" or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the body, increasing the risk for cardiovascular diseases.<BR>Starting last January 1, 2006, food manufacturers are required by FDA to include trans fat content on their food labels, in addition to the saturated fats and cholesterol content. With trans fat added to the Nutrition Facts panel (usually listed under the line of saturated fat), consumers would know how much of all three—saturated, cholesterol and trans fats—are in the foods they choose.<BR>Here are some helpful tips you can keep in mind to make sure that saturated fat, cholesterol and trans fat are maintained low in the diet.<BR>1) When comparing food products, look at the Nutrition Facts panel, and choose the food with the lower amounts of saturated fat, cholesterol and trans fat. In choosing foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol, the general rule of thumb is: 5% of the daily value or less is low, while 20% or more is high. So far, there is still no recommended percent daily value established by the FDA on trans fat. If the amounts of fat in the product are provided (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated), compare the total with the total fat on the label. If they don't agree and you notice that partially hydrogenated oil is listed in the ingredients, the difference is most likely trans fat content.<BR>Also, watch out for claims on packages quoting "low or no cholesterol". Saturated fats may be minimal in these products, but the trans fat is still present.<BR>2) Use monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats found in olive and canola oils, soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil and foods like nuts. These fats do not raise the "bad cholesterol". 3) Avoid solid shortenings, hard margarines, and animal fats, including butter. Use liquid vegetable oils (except coconut and palm kernel oils) instead. 4) Prefer fish (mackerel, sardines, salmon) instead of meat. These contain omega-3 fatty acids, and are low in saturated fats. 5) If meat is inevitable in the diet, choose lean meats such as poultry without the skin and lean beef and pork. All of which should not be fried. 6) Foods high in cholesterol (eggyolk, liver, full-fat dairy products) should be limited in the diet. To view some common foods that were tested for trans fat, you may visit cspinet.org. <BR>Now that nutritional food contents are already provided in Nutrition Facts panel, as responsible consumers, it is imperative for us to know how to understand them. This information can help us a lot in choosing the right foods that we should eat, in order to avoid the risk of acquiring diseases that are preventable in the first place.
20	Bernard Hickey	2011-01-30	http://www.interest.co.nz	Tweet               <BR>Here are my Top 10 links from around the Internet at 10 past 12 pm, brought to you in association with New Zealand Mint for your reading pleasure. <BR>I welcome your additions and comments below, or please send suggestions for tomorrow's Top 10 at 10 via email to bernard.hickey@interest.co.nz . <BR>I'll pop any surplus suggestions I get into the comment stream. <BR> 1. Food stockpiling worsens commodity price boom - This issue of rising food prices and the ensuing social unrest is not going to go away in a hurry. It was a factor in the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. <BR> Here the FT.com reports some governments are stockpiling food, which is worsening the situation. Unless of course you are selling food to the world. <BR>This is a double edged sword. <BR>New Zealand, in theory, benefits with higher food prices, unless of course you are a consumer and want lamb for dinner. <BR>The other risk is that social unrest in the developing countries spills over into growth slowdowns in the only parts of the world growing quickly at the moment -- the BRICs (Brazil, India, Russia and China). <BR>For example, the prices of staples such as ginger and garlic are up more than 70% in the last year in China. The staples of eggplant and onion in India are up more than 60%. <BR>China is desperately trying to slow its economy, with new measures announced daily to control property price inflation and food prices. <BR>Brazil is tightening monetary policy and trying to control capital inflows. <BR>India tightened monetary policy for the 7th time in 10 months last week. <BR>All this is partly because America in particular is printing money and exporting inflation. <BR>Earlier this week, Algeria bought 800,000 tonnes of wheat – much more than usual – and Saudi Arabia announced plans to double the size of its wheat stockpile. <BR>Bangladesh and Indonesia joined the rush on Thursday, placing extraordinary on rice orders. Traders said that Jakarta, which usually buys rice in 200,000-tonne allotments, tendered for more than 800,000 tonnes. Bangladesh said it would double rice purchases this year.   <BR> 2. What's really happening with global trade? - With lots of talk about global recovery it's very strange to see the Baltic Dry Index, which measures the price of shipping bulk goods such a iron ore, coal and soy beans, continuing to slump. <BR> Karl Denninger over at Market ticker has the story and here's the chart courtesy of Bloomberg. <BR>I know there's a capacity (specifically, overcapacity) issue in the ship business, but this is just plain bad. How do you make money on these vessels at that sort of pricing? The decline since September, when people were pointing to a rebound starting, is stunning - and disturbing. <BR>Yes, the solution to too much capacity and low prices is low prices - people go under, then capacity comes off, and price goes up. But remember, the mantra we keep hearing is that the economy worldwide is growing so fast.... well, if it is, why is it that bulk carriers aren't loaded to the gills and able to maintain prices? <BR>As an anecdote I also hear regularly from associates of mine who are involved in the goods trade across national boundaries. There was a set of memos that was circulating around the holidays about expected price increases for non-bulk (e.g. container) shipments; I am now hearing that these have been rescinded.   <BR> 3. Chinese want Australian farms too - The Australian reports China is gearing up for a multi-billion dollar investment push into Australian agriculture to secure food supplies for China's 1.3 billion people. <BR>This push has already started in New Zealand with the arrival last week of Pengxin International to buy the Crafar Farms and the activities of Agria in buying control of PGG Wrightson. <BR>The Australian has learned that interest from Chinese buyers across the whole spectrum of Australian agribusiness has stepped up markedly in the past six months, with the sweet spot being in "under the radar" private farms, aggregation and processing businesses worth between A$10 million and A$200m. <BR>Austrade Beijing's senior trade commissioner, Alan Morrell, said Australia was a logical investment destination for China as the nation moved to strengthen food security. <BR>The Chinese have shown particular interest in potential grain, meat and wool purchases. <BR>"Given the growth of the Chinese economy, the changes in consumer demand and the strategic goals of the central government, Chinese agribusiness companies likely will seek overseas investment opportunities to secure access to supplies of commodities, to strengthen research and development capabilities and to gain access to new markets," Mr Morrell said. <BR> 4. Now they're trying to counterfeit Tom Cruise - Gizmodo reports Chinese Military propagandists tried to pass off footage from the Top Gun movie as footage of a Chinese airforce exercise... <BR>The clips in question were reportedly aired during the News Broadcast program on China Central Television, the major state television broadcast company. They supposedly showed a J-10 fighter firing a missile at another aircraft during a practice exercise. <BR>But an internet commenter quickly pointed out that the aircraft the J-10 was shown shooting down was an F-5, an American aircraft, and the very one Tom Cruise guns down in a scene from Top Gun. Comparing frames from the CCTV broadcast (left) and Top Gun (right), well, they're lookin' pretty much identical. <BR>So that's amusing. There's no word yet on whether or not the Chinese fighter pilots engaged in any beach volleyball after the exercises. <BR> 5. Not enough big new technology advances? - Economist Tyler Cowen writes at the New York Times that one reason why middle and lower incomes in the developed world might have stagnated is a lack of genuinely new and big technological advances in the last thirty years. <BR>My view is the big increase in the profit share of the economy going to financial services may have something to do with widening inequality, but here's Cowen's view... <BR>The income numbers for Americans reflect this slowdown in growth. From 1947 to 1973 — a period of just 26 years — inflation-adjusted median income in the United States more than doubled. But in the 31 years from 1973 to 2004, it rose only 22 percent. And, over the last decade, it actually declined. <BR>Most well-off countries have experienced income growth slowdowns since the early 1970s, so it would seem that a single cause is transcending national borders: the reaching of a technological plateau. The numbers suggest that for almost 40 years, we’ve had near-universal dissemination of the major innovations stemming from the Industrial Revolution, many of which combined efficient machines with potent fossil fuels. <BR>Today, no huge improvement for the automobile or airplane is in sight, and the major struggle is to limit their pollution, not to vastly improve their capabilities. <BR> 6. The problem with Greece - We hear a lot about bureaucracy in Europe and we're pretty lucky when it comes to starting businesses in New Zealand. It's reasonably easy, particularly when compared to this example in Greece of a guy who owns a brewery and wants to make and sell bottled tea. <BR>DEMETRI POLITOPOULOS says he has suffered countless indignities in his 12-year battle to build a microbrewery and wrest a sliver of the Greek beer market from the Dutch colossus, Heineken. His tires have been slashed and his products vandalized by unknown parties, he says, and his brewery has received threatening phone calls. And he says he has had to endure regular taunts — you left Manhattan to start up a beer factory in northern Greece? — not to mention the pain of losing 5.3 million euros. <BR>Bad as all that has been, nothing prepared him for this reality: He would be breaking the law if he tried to fulfill his latest — and, he thinks, greatest — entrepreneurial dream. It is to have his brewery produce and export bottles of a Snapple-like beverage made from herbal tea, which he is cultivating in the mountains that surround this lush pocket of the country. <BR>An obscure edict requires that brewers in Greece produce beer — and nothing else. Mr. Politopoulos has spent the better part of the last year trying fruitlessly to persuade the Greek government to strike it. “It’s probably a law that goes back to King Otto,” said Mr. Politopoulos with a grim chuckle, referring to the Bavarian-born king of Greece who introduced beer to the country around 1850. <BR>But here's the really juicy stuff. <BR>The Greek economy is riddled with distortions — the number of trucking licenses has remained unchanged in Greece since 1971, for example, and the country is among the world’s leaders in lawyers per capita. It has one lawyer for every 250 people, compared with about one for 272 in the United States. <BR>The effect on Greek competitiveness could not be more pernicious. The cost of labor in Greece from 2005 to 2010 has been, on average, 25 percent higher than in Germany, according to a recent analysis by Variant Perception, a research firm based in London. (Ireland, Portugal and Spain also have relatively high labor costs.) Quite simply, Greece has had trouble producing goods and services that people want to buy — a result being a persistently high trade deficit that even now, amid the deepest of recessions, has hardly budged.   <BR> 7. Is China already bigger than America? - Most people think that China's economy is likely to be bigger than America's within 10 to 20 years if the current respective growth rates continue going up (for China) and sideways (for America). Here Arvind Subramanian reckons that China's economy is already bigger than America's on a purchasing power parity basis... <BR>Some time in 2010, the Chinese economy overtook that of the United States. My calculations of GDP for 2010—which of course are subject to the uncertainty associated with all such exercises—are based on new estimates of GDP that will soon be published by the Penn World Tables (PWT) under the guidance of Professor Alan Heston at the University of Pennsylvania. <BR>Cross-country comparisons of economic size and standards of living of the average citizen rely on two approaches. The first uses market exchange rates to convert the economic value of goods and services produced around the world into a common currency, usually the dollar. According to the IMF’s latest estimates for 2010, the value of total US GDP was $14.6 trillion while that of China was $5.7 trillion. <BR>But it has long been recognized by many economists that using the market exchange rate to value goods and services is misleading about the real costs of living in two countries. Such goods and services as medical services, retail and constructions services, and haircuts—which are not traded across borders—are cheaper in poorer countries because labor is abundant. Using the market exchange rate to compare living standards across countries understates the benefits that citizens in poor countries enjoy from having access to these goods and services.   <BR> 8. Are China's numbers real ? - Closely-watched Bejing-based economic academic Michael Pettis has written a long, detailed and ultimately provocative post wondering if China's figures on GDP can be believed. <BR>Every country wastes investment, but China does it on a massive scale. I would argue that at least 1-2 percentage points of Chinese growth, perhaps even more, might consist of this kind of misallocated investment-driven growth. When you add the impact of misallocated investment and environmental degradation, the necessary cumulative adjustment to Chinese GDP might be huge. <BR>For example, if the two adjustments combined range from 2 to 4 percentage points annually, over one decade China’s “true” GDP (whatever that means), would be below the official numbers by anywhere from 16-31%. <BR>Over twenty years official GDP would be overstated by 31-52%. <BR>That means that we are massively overstating GDP today and will experience very low apparent GDP growth for many years in the future as the official number returns to some reasonable approximation of the real number.   <BR> 9. Here Yves Smith from the Naked Capitalist points to Pettis' piece. <BR>She is sceptical too. <BR>Having worked with the Japanese in their bubble years, I may be too conscious of the parallels to both the hype and the conditions on the ground in China. China is under more pressure (due to the state of the global economy and the expectations of its people) to keep employment high, but in the long run, building cities and office buildings that sit largely or entirely vacant is ultimately as wasteful as buying white elephant golf courses and resorts abroad. <BR>The losses on lending against land, which went into stock market speculation and a foreign buying binge, blew back to the Japanese banking system. <BR>As discussed earlier, the Chinese banks recovered from their 2002-3 banking crisis at the cost of considerable economic distortions, and it does not appear the officialdom can rely on the same covert bailout strategy a second time. So if they are hit again with serious loan losses, the real economy impact is likely to be more serious that the China bulls believe possible.   <BR>10.

22	Dr TEE E SIONG	2011-01-30	http://thestar.com.my.feedsportal.com	Meet your daily energy and nutrient needs by consuming adequate amounts of whole grain cereals.<BR>THE body needs energy for various vital body processes, including maintaining body temperature, metabolic activity, supporting growth, and for daily physical activities. This energy need is met by the foods we consume daily.<BR>The required energy is derived from metabolising (burning) carbohydrates, fat, and protein contained in food. Nutritionists recommend that the bulk (55-70%) of the energy needs of a person is to be met by carbohydrates; 15-30% from fat; and the remaining 10-15% from protein.<BR>We should thus consume adequate amounts of carbohydrate-rich foods to supply the energy we need. The main foods rich in carbohydrate are rice, other cereals, and tubers.<BR>Let us therefore discuss the fourth key message of the Malaysian Dietary Guidelines (MDG) 2010: eat adequate amounts of rice, other cereal products (preferably whole grain), and tubers.<BR>The MDG 2010 is a set of advisory statements aimed at promoting appropriate dietary patterns and active living. I have summarised the 14 key messages contained in the MDG 2010 and dealt with in detail three of the key messages in previous write ups in this column.<BR>This key message highlights the importance of consuming cereals and cereal products as well as tubers. These foods are the preferred source of energy and should be relied upon to supply most of our daily energy needs.<BR>Whole grain cereals are particularly recommended as they contain numerous other needed nutrients. They form the base of the pyramid and should be consumed the most, relative to the other food groups.<BR>Cereals are important food sources<BR>Cereals and cereal-based products are the most important source of food and provide the major source of energy and protein. The cereals most commonly consumed by the world population are wheat, maize, rice, barley, sorghum, oats, rye and millet.<BR>Eating enough cereal foods help to ensure an adequate nutritional intake. Cereals are an excellent choice to provide more than 55% of total energy.<BR>For billions of people, particularly those in developing countries, rice is the main source of calorie. In addition, rice, especially undermilled rice, is also a source of other nutrients such as fibre, several B vitamins and several minerals.<BR>For these reasons, cereal whole grains form the basis of diets in many different cultures and cuisines for 3,000 to 4,000 years. Indeed, most current dietary guidelines have cereal foods as the largest component of the recommended daily food intake.<BR>Unfortunately, within the past 100 years or so, a majority of the population has consumed refined grain products.<BR>Recognising the nutritional value of cereal foods, the Food Pyramid of the MDG 2010 has placed cereals and cereal products at the base of the pyramid and recommends that these should be consumed the most, relative to other food groups. It certainly does not mean that these foods can be consumed in large amounts.<BR>We need to remember that excessive intake of such food will result in too much carbohydrate intake and can lead to excessive energy intake. This, in turn, can lead to overweight and obesity. Consume just adequate amounts according to your age, gender, and daily activities.<BR>Whole grain cereals are more nutritious<BR>The term whole grain is frequently used in connection with cereals, e.g. wheat, rice, maize, oats, rye. Whole grains, as well as foods made from them, consist of the entire grain seed (called the kernel). The kernel is made of three components: bran, germ, and endosperm.<BR>Whole grains have a high content of carbohydrate and nutrients. The bran and germ are rich in dietary fibre; nutrients, e.g. several B vitamins (like thiamine, niacin, vitamin B6); minerals (like iron, zinc, magnesium and phosphorus); and beneficial phytochemicals (like phenolic compounds, phytoestrogens and plant sterols). The endosperm is rich in starch and is a good energy source.<BR>During the grain-refining process, the bran and germ of the grain are removed and only the starchy inner part of the grain remains. The grain is now termed as refined-grain product, e.g. refined or white rice, refined wheat flour.<BR>With the removal of the bran and germ, which contain the major amount of nutrients and dietary fibre, the nutritional value of the refined product is drastically reduced.<BR>The MDG 2010 has therefore recommended that when cereals are consumed, the whole grain varieties are preferred to be eaten. The consumption of whole grains in the country is still very low. Consumers are encouraged to look for products containing whole grains, e.g. whole grain bread, biscuits, breakfast cereals.<BR>When a label of such products claim they are made from whole grains, do look out for those that state the amount or percentage of whole grains that it contains. Select those with more whole grains in them.<BR>Main cereal foods of Malaysians<BR>Rice is the staple food of this country. Almost the whole population consumes rice twice daily, sometimes as porridge. White rice is invariably the choice of the population.<BR>Greater efforts should be made by the community to consume under-milled rice or brown rice as they are of much higher nutritional value.<BR>A variety of rice products are also consumed. These include a variety of products made from rice flour, and include several noodle-type products, such as mee-hoon, mee-sua, kueh-teow, lo-see-fun and mee-laksa. These are useful ingredients to prepare rather complete meals, after adding some meat or fish products plus plenty of vegetables.<BR>You should prepare these meals with less oil and coconut milk. There are also several local kuih made from rice flour, e.g. bidaran, kuih kasui, kuih bom, kuih buah Melaka, kuih karas, kuih koci, and kuih talam. These foods should be consumed only in moderate amounts as many of these are high in sugar and contain coconut milk.<BR>A variety of wheat flour products are consumed by wide segments of the community. Bread is certainly the most common one. The preference should be for the healthier alternatives of whole grain or wholemeal bread, as well as those with other grains added.<BR>A number of products made from wheat flour is also commonly consumed, the most popular being noodle (mee). Cake is also made from wheat flour, but we should take note that it could be high in fat and sugar. Several local kuih are also made from wheat flour, e.g. dumpling, kuih apam, apam balik, and kuih ketayap.<BR>As for rice flour products, we should opt for varieties of these that contain less sugar, coconut milk and fat.<BR>Tubers are also good sources of energy<BR>Tubers are the fleshy underground swelling of stem or root strands that normally contain varying amounts of starch. Root and tuber crops are consumed as food in many countries in the world.<BR>However, their contribution to the energy supply of the population varies within a large range, depending on the country.<BR>Many species and varieties are consumed but three species such as cassava, potato, and sweet potato provide more than 90% of the root and tuber crops used for direct human consumption.<BR>Tubers are also sometimes consumed in this country. The common tubers include cassava, potato, sweet potato and yam. Tubers are also rich in carbohydrates, with similar protein levels compared to cereals. But their fat content is very low, resulting in slightly lower energy levels than that of cereals.<BR>The MDG 2010 has grouped tubers together with cereals and cereal products, placed at the base of the food pyramid.<BR>I would like to promote the consumption of red varieties of sweet potato and yam, in view of their interesting flavours and the carotenoids they contain.<BR>Changes in cereal and tuber consumption<BR>The food balance sheet data of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) provides information on the trends of consumption of major food items in Malaysia. Examining the data over the past 45 years, the contribution of cereals to total daily energy was found to have declined dramatically, from an initial value of 60% in 1961, to about 46% in 2007.<BR>The contribution of roots and tubers to daily total energy remained at a low level of around 2% over the last four decades. Further increase in the consumption of these food crops can be encouraged.<BR>The decline in energy contribution by cereals over the years has been replaced by increase in consumption of meat, fish, and egg. This group of animal foods contributed to 6% of total daily energy in the 1960s and increased steadily to about 13% in 2007.<BR>Increase in energy contribution was also from fats and oils (mostly plant oils), which increased from 12% to 15% over the same time period. There was also an increase in energy intake from sweeteners, from 10% to 13%.<BR>Such changes in food consumption pattern have important impact to the nutrient intake of the population. The lowered intake of cereals is expected to give rise to a decrease in consumption of dietary fibre, some B vitamins and minerals, and several beneficial phytochemicals.<BR>On the other hand, the increase in intake of animal foods and fats and oils is expected to result in increased intake of total daily energy, saturated fat, and cholesterol. These changes in nutrient intake have important implications and are believed to play an important role in the increase in obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancers that we have witnessed in this country over the past four decades.<BR>Let the MDG 2010 guide you and your family members in adopting healthy eating habits and an active lifestyle.

How about red wine, steak, pizza? <BR>Happily, there are nutrition rules for men that cut through the latest fads. These are timeless tips on what to eat and when to eat it, and what else to do to make sure your diet is giving you everything you need without giving you too much of anything you don't. <BR>These are the basics. Make these 10 top nutrition tips for men the foundation of your diet and you won't go far wrong. <BR>Always cook too much <BR>Whatever you cook, it's almost bound to be healthier than salt and fat laden ready-meals and take-aways. One Chinese lemon chicken has been cited as the unhealthiest take-away of all, with one version clocking up a whopping 1,871 calories! Trouble is, we all fall back on junk and fast food when cooking feels like too much of a chore. <BR>So when you do cook, always cook too much. Which is fundamentally different from eating too much, of course. That way the fridge and freezer will always be full of quick and easy curries and pasta dishes which you can call on, rather than your local take-away. <BR>Buy what you need <BR>And only what you need. Don't shop hungry or the morning after a heavy night and you won't be tempted to fill your trolley with sugary treats and other assorted junk food. With food, we don't tend to crave things we can't easily have. So if there are no biscuits in the house, you won't hear them whispering to you in the night. <BR>Don't go hungry — graze <BR>Men need to eat small meals every two or three hours. If you let yourself get really hungry, your body will go into survival mode and store food as fat. Eating a little regularly will keep your metabolism ticking over nicely. <BR>Eat protein <BR>Even if you're dieting you should still eat plenty of lean protein — and remember, men need more protein than women (tell her that when she complains that you've given yourself the biggest steak!) Protein helps to build muscle, which in turn burns more calories. Vary where you get your protein from — fish, meat, nuts, eggs and dairy are all good sources. A great protein dinner is salmon or grilled chicken with sautéed potatoes and steamed vegetables. It makes for a low fat, protein rich meal. <BR>Avoid dehydration <BR>If you're thirsty, drink water. Not alcohol, not caffeinated drinks or soft drinks. Water. Water is essential for keeping you energised — even mild dehydration will make you want to skip that session at the gym. Fill up a large glass with water early on in your day and have it handy for where you work — it's a good reminder to take a swig every now and then. <BR>Cut carbs <BR>Many of us eat too many carbs, with meals packed with pasta, rice, bread or potatoes. Don't banish them from your diet — they provide energy — but don't overload on them. Go for wholemeal or brown alternatives whenever possible. <BR>Fill up on fibre <BR>Fibre isn't just good for your bowels (though it is very good for your bowels) it also makes you feel fuller for longer, meaning you're not tempted by unhealthy snacks. Fibre rich foods also give a steady release of energy and nutrients throughout the day. Think fruit and veg, lentils, oats and brown rice. A mixed vegetable curry with brown basmati rice is a great source of fibre, and porridge for breakfast will make sure you start the day with a reliable energy source. <BR>Eat what you want... <BR>...on one day a week. If you want a take-away curry, go for it (though maybe go for a tomato-based one rather than a creamy one). If you could murder a stodgy pudding, go ahead. The key is to get into a routine where unhealthy treats are exactly that — treats. There's nothing wrong with pretty much anything if you're only having it from time to time. Everything in moderation, as they say. <BR>Eat like a man <BR>By which we mean, don't eat like a woman. If you think following your girlfriend's diet will make sure you lose weight, you might be right. But you'll be a tired, listless husk of a man. Fact is, an average man needs to consume around 700 calories more than his female counterpart every single day. <BR>Get spicy <BR>Learn how to use herbs and spices in your cooking. Bland foods make you want to reach for the strong flavours found in foods laden with sugar, salt and fat. If your meals are full of flavour anyway, you won't crave the taste of an unhealthy alternative. We don't just mean spicy curries. Add mixed herbs to stews and soups, and there aren't many dishes that can't be improved by a little garlic or chilli. <BR>And there you have it. If you have a specific goal — to lose weight or build muscle — you can modify accordingly, but follow our 10 tips and you have the foundations of healthy nutrition.

Subscribe to Emaxhealth by Email <BR>For about 3 million people in the United States who have celiac disease, wheat is the enemy. Living gluten-free can be a challenge, but there are some people who are making it easier for celiacs to live in a wheat world. <BR>Gluten-free foods are becoming easier to find <BR>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease in which individuals cannot tolerate foods that contain gluten, a protein found in all forms of wheat (e.g., durum, kamut, semolina, spelt) as well as related grains such as barley, rye, and triticale. Since 1974, the rate of celiac disease has doubled every 15 years in the United States, with approximately 1 in 133 people living with the disease. <BR>Because so many foods are wheat-based or contain gluten, including many processed foods, individuals who must avoid gluten can have a difficult time finding foods they can eat, both at home and especially when eating out. Buying a simple loaf of bread or box of pasta, for example, means they must look for products made from rice, corn, or amaranth flour. <BR>Awareness of the plight of those with celiac is growing. Among those offering assistance to celiac sufferers is the Celiac Sprue Association, which provides a comprehensive food list intended to help individuals choose gluten-free foods. Gluten-free foods are available from a growing number of companies, some of which include Glutino, Gluten-Free Pantry, Bakery on Main, Bob’s Red Mill, Cream Hill Estates, Ener-G, Maxwell’s Kitchen, Namaste, Nature’s Path, PureFit, Thai Kitchen, and Tinkyada, among others. <BR>The Children’s Digestive Health and Nutrition Foundation offers a comprehensive online guide called “Gluten-Free Diet Guide for Families,” which provides critical information such as “Overlooked Sources of Gluten,” a gluten-free shopping list, and tips on how to eat away from home. <BR>If you are looking for grocery stores that carry gluten-free foods, there is a website called Gluten Free Groceries where you can look for such supermarkets by state. Whole Foods, Safeway, Hy-Vee, and Trader Joes are among the grocery stores best known for carrying gluten-free foods. <BR>On the restaurant scene, chefs are gradually catering to the special dietary needs of those who cannot tolerate gluten. In Atlantic City, for example, the restaurant at Harrah’s Resorts serves up gluten-free food. At that restaurant, James Harris is the only chef in an Atlantic City casino restaurant that has been trained through the National Foundation of Celiac Awareness of Philadelphia, according to a report in the Cape May County Herald. If you are looking for a restaurant in your area that caters to celiac customers, you can check out various celiac-friendly restaurant directories online. <BR>The need for a gluten-free diet can be especially troublesome for the elderly, who often have other health problems as well and may have difficulties getting proper nutrition. A gluten-free diet may also be helpful for people who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. <BR>People who have celiac disease face daily challenges living in a wheat world. However, awareness of the need for more gluten-free foods is growing, and resources are available. <BR>SOURCES: <BR>Cape May County Herald <BR>Celiac Sprue Foundation <BR>Children’s Digestive Health and Nutrition Foundation

Photo: Louise Cooper Rating: 20 out of 5 stars Every time I eat in Docklands I think maybe this will be the restaurant that lets me love it. I went with high hopes to Woolshed, which recently launched its upstairs dining room with some fanfare, largely due to name chefs Donovan Cooke and Cath Kalka leading the cooking. The Woolshed's name makes no secret of the huge building's origins. The ground-level bar, deck and function areas are handsome and flexible; I'd happily return for beers or a party. The casual dining area is next to an open kitchen that runs a classy pub menu of croquettes, salads, burgers and the like. Nearby is a sneaky stairway to the upstairs dining room, which works from a separate kitchen. The fine-dining food ranged from unremarkable to disappointing but even taking eating out of the equation, the upscale offering is a puzzling misfire. The dining room has a terrific view of Etihad Stadium but declines to show off the harbour. It's comfortable, but the spill of stadium neon undermines otherwise pleasant lighting. Service was caring and efficient, though there was too much inquiry into our enjoyment and the napkin-lapping and crumb-scraping suggested standards that made the food even more disappointing. The wine list is a nice spread of familiar and far-reaching but bottles under $50 are rare. Cigars round off the list: puff on the deck. Our entrees weren't bad, especially a pretty mud crab salad rising from cantaloupe soup, though the delicate shellfish was overwhelmed by its syrupy tropical bath. Main courses weren't great. Whole baby barramundi was mushy and undistinguished, scattered with a citrus salsa that lacked punch. The fish lay unhelpfully on a bed of spinach (it made me think of a cat sitting on a newspaper that you're trying to read). A lamb platter featured a tasty cutlet and rump slices that didn't repay the chewing necessary to swallow them. They came with squeaky undercooked eggplant and a potato-olive mix that was too broken down to be "crushed" but too lumpy to be mash. Goodbye $40. The sides were clumsy: I couldn't tell the difference between the mixed salad and supermarket mix. Passable passionfruit bavarois came with lychee sorbet marred by chunks of ice. Even without the technical flaws, the menu doesn't strike me as a $230 (for two) experience. I'll keep going to Docklands because I want my mind changed but this wasn't the meal to do it.

I went with high hopes to Woolshed, which recently launched its upstairs dining room with some fanfare, largely due to name chefs Donovan Cooke and Cath Kalka leading the cooking. The Woolshed's name makes no secret of the huge building's origins. The ground-level bar, deck and function areas are handsome and flexible; I'd happily return for beers or a party. The casual dining area is next to an open kitchen that runs a classy pub menu of croquettes, salads, burgers and the like. Nearby is a sneaky stairway to the upstairs dining room, which works from a separate kitchen. The fine-dining food ranged from unremarkable to disappointing but even taking eating out of the equation, the upscale offering is a puzzling misfire. The dining room has a terrific view of Etihad Stadium but declines to show off the harbour. It's comfortable, but the spill of stadium neon undermines otherwise pleasant lighting. Service was caring and efficient, though there was too much inquiry into our enjoyment and the napkin-lapping and crumb-scraping suggested standards that made the food even more disappointing. The wine list is a nice spread of familiar and far-reaching but bottles under $50 are rare. Cigars round off the list: puff on the deck. Our entrees weren't bad, especially a pretty mud crab salad rising from cantaloupe soup, though the delicate shellfish was overwhelmed by its syrupy tropical bath. Main courses weren't great. Whole baby barramundi was mushy and undistinguished, scattered with a citrus salsa that lacked punch. The fish lay unhelpfully on a bed of spinach (it made me think of a cat sitting on a newspaper that you're trying to read). A lamb platter featured a tasty cutlet and rump slices that didn't repay the chewing necessary to swallow them. They came with squeaky undercooked eggplant and a potato-olive mix that was too broken down to be "crushed" but too lumpy to be mash. Goodbye $40. The sides were clumsy: I couldn't tell the difference between the mixed salad and supermarket mix. Passable passionfruit bavarois came with lychee sorbet marred by chunks of ice. Even without the technical flaws, the menu doesn't strike me as a $230 (for two) experience. I'll keep going to Docklands because I want my mind changed but this wasn't the meal to do it.

4	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.kuwaittimes.net	HAVANA: Where some might see a rotten window frame pocked by termites, Julio Cesar Hidalgo envisions a polished take-out counter, the rich smell of garlic and oregano wafting out onto a warm Havana street. In his mind's eye, the coarsely laid concrete covering the surfaces of his shabby living room already is a gleaming white countertop laid with sandwiches, pastries, and balls of yeasty dough; a gas oven in the coner bakes mouthwatering pizza. After Cuban authorities announced in September that they were opening the island's closed Marxist economy to a limited amount of private enterprise, Hidalgo was one of the first to line up for a new business license. Ever since, the 31-year-old baker has been transforming the front of his narrow apartment in a run-down section of Old Havana into a standup pizza joint and cafe. In a land of modest dreams, Hidalgo says his is simple: to be the master of his own labor. It's not going to make me rich," he laughs, adding that he may make only a little more than he does now in a $12-a-month job at a state-run bakery. "But I'll be working in my own home, and I'll be my own boss." Hidalgo and tens of thousands like him are chasing their entrepreneurial ambitions in 2011, Cuba's year of economic change, hopeful that a sweeping overhaul of the economy announced last year by President Raul Castro is for real. The Cuban leader said the country would lay off half a million state workers by March 31, while granting licenses for a broad, if slightly random, array of businesses. The new entrepreneurs face towering challenges in getting their enterprises off the ground, including high taxes, a lack of raw materials, an uncertain customer base, labyrinthine bureaucratic rules and limited access to startup capital. Yet, their success or failure will go a long way toward determining the future of Cuba's revolution. The Cuban state now employs 84 percent of the island's workers and controls 90 percent of the economy in one of the world's last bastions of Soviet-style communism. If the free-market experiment works, the cash-strapped government could shed millions of dollars from its payroll while boosting much-needed tax revenues and creating a new business and consumer class. It could also legalize part of a booming black market that provides everything from sausages to satellite television. If the experiment fails, however, this already disillusioned and dysfunctional country will have turned hundreds of thousands of people out of their government jobs and into an uncertain future. All of this in the same year that Raul Castro turns 80, and his older brother Fidel is widely expected to step down from his final official post - head of the Communist Party. Through January 7, more than 75,000 people had received new licenses, joining about 143,000 private sector workers left over from the islan d's last dabble with capitalism. Government economists say they hope a quarter of a million new entrepreneurs eventually will sign up. Almost all the new businesses are small, operating out of homes or on street corners. But the stakes for Cuba could not be higher, with the economy weighed down by crippling disorganization, a broken infrastructure, endemic corruption and an enormous labor force that has become accustomed to getting paid very little, and doing very little in return. Among the thousands who have taken the leap into private enterprise are Maria Regla Saldivar, a 52-year-old black belt in Tae Kwon Do who plans to open a gymnasium in the ruins of a destroyed laundromat, and Javier Acosta, who has opened an upscale restaurant catering to tourists. There is Danilo Perez, a 21-year-old accountant who has received a license to buy and sell bootleg DVDs in Havana's hardscrabble El Cerro neighborhood, and Anisia Cardenas, a seamstress with a license to make clothes. Many others are giving manicures, painting homes, fixing cars and driving taxis, services on the list of 178 officially sanctioned private activities. Some of the other opportunities are a bit more obscure, such as fresh fruit peeling. Some are so specific they refer to just two people, like No. 159, which makes it legal to be part of the Amor Dance Duo Even the Cuban government, in an internal document to party leaders obtained by The Associated Press, warned that many of the businesses will fail within a year. And many Cubans say privately that they will wait and see if ventures such as Hidalgo's prosper before jumping into the fray themselves. But for now, optimism and excitement reign among the new entrepreneurs. "We are going to be a success. I am sure of it," says Gisselle de la Noval, 20, Hidalgo's bright-faced girlfriend, who will work the till at the pizzeria and share in its profits. "This (economic) opening was marvelous. ... I think those who know how to take advantage of it will have a bright future. A dismal state of affairs Cuba's push to open its economy to private enterprise does not indicate an ideological change of heart among its Communist leaders. It is based on necessity. The economy has been slammed by the global economic downturn, a drop in nickel prices and the fallout from three devastating hurricanes that hit in quick succession in 2008. Revenues from tobacco, rum and sugar have fallen, as have remittances from Cubans living overseas. Prevented from borrowing from international monetary institutions by the 48-ye ar US trade embargo, Cuba was forced to reduce food and other imports from its main trading partners by 37 percent. The economy grew by just 1.4 percent and 2.1 percent respectively in 2009 and 2010, a terrible performance for a small, developing country, and figures that many economists dismiss as a fantasy anyway, since Cuba counts state spending on social programs when calculating economic growth. Even state-run newspapers have been filled with stories of extraordinary inefficiency, with dozens of "watchmen" paid by the state to guard fallow fields, or the hospital where 30 emergency workers stand idle because all have been assigned to a single ambulance. "My fear is that the Cuban state is completely broke," says Uva de Aragon, a Cuba expert at Florida International University. "I don't want to think about what will happen, even in the medium-term, if (the free enterprise experiment) doesn't work. Shortages are everywhere: in the sparse shelves at state-run supermarkets; along the unlit city streets and empty, rutted highways; in the antiquated factories on the outskirts of cities and in the tractorless farms dotting the countryside, many still relying on oxen to till the earth. The country of 11.2 million people has the lowest Internet penetration in the Western Hemisphere. The state pays workers salaries of about $20 a month in return for free health care and education, and nearly free transporta tion, utilities and housing. At least a portion of every citizen's food needs are sold to them through ration books at heavily subsidized prices. Getting by on those salaries is such a struggle that stealing from state-owned companies is endemic, a major perquisite of having a job, and a frightening loss for those about to be laid off. The thievery also represents a huge cost to the government, one reason the country finds itself in such dire economic straits. Since taking over from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006, first temporaril y, then permanently, Raul Castro has been whittling away at the subsidies. In recent months he has cut free workplace lunches, removed potatoes, peas, cigarettes, soap, detergent and toothpaste from the ration book, and suggested the whole system must eventually be scrapped. Just how bad things had gotten became apparent in September, with a red-letter headline in the Communist Party newspaper Granma that the state would lay off a tenth of the island's work force, while opening up the private sector. Days later, authorities published the list of 178 activities in which new licens es would be issued. The list steers clear of activities that could present a threat to the state's monopoly on most economic activity. There are no licenses for independent lawyers, bankers or engineers, nor for Cubans to work privately in strategic sectors such as mining or hotel management. Still, there is no overestimating the scope of the change. For the first time since the 1960s, Cubans will be able to hire employees. They may rent out their homes and cars more freely, and hope to one day get business loans from state banks. Raul Castro even called a rare Communist Party Congress, scheduled for April 16-19, in which the reforms wi ll be enshrined as the country's only and unbreakable way forward. The new entrepreneurs Hidalgo is a round-faced man with a permanently amused look in his eyes. Unlike most Cubans, he has been down the free enterprise road before, with disastrous results. Cuba last opened up to some private enterprise following the collapse of its Soviet benefactor in the 1990s, which ushered in an era of extreme hardship known as the "Special Period." Back then, a 17-year-old Hidalgo and an older cousin tried the same thing. They opened a pizza joint in the same dingy apartment in 1997, only to find it was impossible to buy the cheese, flour and tomato paste they needed to make the pies in state-owned shops. They turned to the black market, and ran into trouble. "The inspectors would show up ... sometimes once a week, sometimes twice a week," Hidalgo says. "They demanded receipts, and when I couldn't provide them they confiscated everything. They forced us to close." In those days, Fidel Castro described the reforms as a necessary evil and quickly scaled them back once the crisis had ebbed. From a high of 209,000 license holders for private enterprise in 1996, Cuba's tiny entrepreneurial class had dropped by a third by 2010. Raul Castro has vowed it will be different this time around, telling Parliament in December that "the life of the revolution is in the balance." The government has pledged an initial investment of $130 million to purchase the raw materials new businesses will need, and Hidalgo pointed to a stack of unopened boxes of white tile he purchased for $8 a box in a state-owned shop. Still, the path to self-employment promises to be tough. Given the price of ingredients, Hidalgo thinks he will have to charge upward of 20 pesos ($1) for a personal-size pizza with olives and oregano, a small fortune for anybody living strictly on a Cuban government wage. And he already has competition: Two neighbors on his rundown Old Havana street have licenses to open cafes. The government has made it easier for Cubans to rent space to each other, but there is no retail property available for private citizens, and few would have rent money even if there wer e. Most people either must carve out part of their home, or come up with creative ideas to get around the real estate shortage. Saldivar, the martial arts black belt, beamed with excitement as she walked through the skeleton of a building that was once an industrial laundry in Havana's Nuevo Vedado neighborhood. She is petitioning the government to turn over title to the property so she can transform it into a gymnasium, and meanwhile, is using a small park nearby to hold fitness classes. The building has no roof or walls, and the oil-stained concrete floor is littered with truck-sized pieces of rusted machinery, but Saldivar is no t deterred. I'll fix it up," she insists. Her bigger worry is that authorities have not included martial arts in the list of acceptable activities. Saldivar says she will either have to limit her classes to aerobics, or "inventar," a Cuban specialty that roughly translates as "to improvise." "I don't plan to give Tae Kwon Do classes," she deadpans. "I'm teaching the kids 'Quimbumbia'," Saldivar's word for a discipline remarkably similar to Tae Kwon Do. - AP

Popcorn is a simple snack synonymous with watching movies and fun nostalgia. In Sacramento, you could listen to the Sacramento web site for many different ideas of what to do when you can celebrate a national day almost every day of the year.<BR>Curried Popcorn with Extra Virgin Olive Oil Also there's a Greek-style popcorn recipe at the CD Kitchen website. And if you like Italian popcorn, there's a recipe at: Rachel Ray's website where you're invited by the Food Network to see that recipe at the website, . Also for more popcorn recipes for , see: . People in the USA eat about 16 billion quarts of popcorn each year. That's about 54 quarts per person. Popcorn is said to have been created in India and China more than 5,000 years ago, as a game where kernels were popped over sizzling hearths. The game consisted of trying to catch the kernels in mid-air. But only in the 1980s did popcorn become available in stores prepared for modern microwave ovens.<BR>What makes a quality popcorn? It's how much moisture is in its kernel. Food scientists sometimes even measure the expansion ratio of the kernel using math formulas. Chefs look at food processing procedures.<BR>Pocorn industry researchers study storage and handling at home as well as in transit and in the plant. It goes back to the genes in the corn kernel and whether the corn kernel is or is not genetically modified by scientists in the seed form or whether the corn is organic or full of pesticides while growing on the farm. So it's all a history of how our food is produced before it reaches your home. There's celebrated on January 31st of each year. And then there's National Popcorn Month, celebrated in October. Caramel Popcorn Day is April 7th. You can see why popcorn days are celebrated at least three times annually.

Instead of the usual poporn recipes for various nut butter popcorn recipes calling for familiar or traditional ingredients such as: 1 cup light corn syrup, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, and 2 quarts popped popcorn, how about substituting healthier ingredients your body really needs, such as almond or cashew butter instead of peanut butter full of a lot of Omega 6 fatty acids?<BR>Try some nuts that contain more of a balance of omega 3, 6, and 9 in various proportions...such as the almond or cashew butter. Or mix pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, almond butter, and cashew butter in some amounts together in a blender or food processor and use in place of commercial peanut butter.<BR>Instead use almond or cashew nut butter. Or use sesame tahini in small amounts to roll into the popcorn and then roll in black sesame seeds or chia seeds. And instead of the cup of sugar and cup of corn syrup, just leave out the sweet stuff from the popcorn. Keep the corn and nuts, and ditch the sugar and corn syrup. Don't use peanuts. Use a handful of walnuts or some almonds and walnuts mixed with sunflower seeds and sesame seeds or some pumpkin seeds.<BR>In stead of sugar or syrup, substitute a healthier alternative such as pureed banana for the usual recipes you find online that call for sugar/corn syrup mixture to pour over popcorn. If you don't want to puree a banana on your popcorn, use dried fruit such as pitted dates, figs, nectarines, raisins, currants, apricots, or any dried fruit you like instead of sugar or corn syrup over popcorn.<BR>Remember to brush your teeth after eating caramel or nut-butter and dried fruit puree popcorn.

By seasoning every quarter at a time, it keeps the wonderful curried seasoning taste through the whole batch of spicy popcorn. Instead of butter, you're using olive oil. If you don't like olive oil, you can substitute the olive oil for walnut oil, sesame seed oil, or macadamia nut oil. Some people like grape seed oil or rice bran oil. Choose the flavor of the oil you like most before you add the curry spices, garlic, and pepper to marinate the oil.

They are a way to celebrate the success of the past year and express hope for a prosperous new year.<BR>The idea is yu, meaning surplus or extra, a concept deeply ingrained because in ancient times there was much privation. Surplus was always a blessing.<BR>In fact, some older people take this idea so seriously that the word "enough" is not permitted before and during the holiday. There is never enough. So today the tables groan with food, platters overflow and some dishes are deliberately not eaten - there is always something extra. <BR>But privation is not a problem today. A week-long holiday filled with big rich meals, sometimes twice a day, when visiting relatives is too much for most digestive systems.<BR>Doctors see more digestive problems during this festive season. Their common-sense advice: moderation and good nutrition. Eat a little of everything but don't stuff yourself.<BR>Gastroenteritis and inflammation of the gallbladder are very common during Spring Festival, says Dr Zhou Duan, head of Internal Medicine of Longhua Hospital attached to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.<BR>"Of course, big dinners are essential, but I advise people to get control of their eating, especially if they have chronic problems with diabetes, digestion, the liver or cardiovascular system," he says.<BR>Overloading the system with big blasts of high-fat and high-sugar foods can add weight and aggravate problems, such as high blood pressure.<BR>Though eating a plain diet is not feasible, people should try for meals with a balance of starches, proteins, fats, vegetables and fruits.<BR>Eating fiber in the form of fruit, vegetables and coarse, whole grains improves digestion and moves the bowels. Oats, buckwheat, millet, corn and other grains are recommended.<BR>Drinking alcohol is a must for most people during festivals, but a lot of alcohol damages the liver and long-term drinking can cause blood-clotting problems, fatty-liver, hepatitis and cirrhosis.<BR>As the chief organ for metabolizing alcohol, the liver works overtime when one over-drinks and function can be impaired, according to Dr Zhou Ronggen, associate chief physician of the TCM section of the Internal Medicine Department of Yueyang Hospital. <BR>The Chinese Society of Hepatology suggests that men should not drink more than 20g of alcohol per day while women should drink less than 10g.Ten grams usually amounts to 284ml beer, 118ml wine, 78ml yellow rice wine or 25ml distilled spirit (50-proof).<BR>Drinking a small amount of red wine every day has cardiovascular benefits and can help with high blood fat and blood pressure, but benefits do not outweigh dangers of over-drinking. It is advised to drink no more than 50ml a day.<BR>People with liver problems, high blood pressure and cardiac problems should avoid alcohol.Having some food before drinking can help protect the digestive system, but this doesn't reduce liver damage.<BR>Healthy drinking tips<BR>1. Avoid drinking on an empty stomach.<BR>2. While drinking, eat foods that benefit the stomach and spleen, such as lotus root and yams. They can help protect the digestive system.<BR>3. For those who drink a lot, lotus root, yams and hangover treatments can help if taken regularly. TCM capsules known as Hu Gan Pian (liver-protecting tablets) can help.<BR>4.

46	Barbara Nefer	2011-01-30	http://www.examiner.com	Who but Disney would name and theme a restaurant after a rat and have people flocking to pay $75 a head to get in?<BR>The restaurant is Remy, named for the rodent who longed to be a chef in the movie “Ratatouille.” But while it is themed after the Pixar feature, the tie-in is rather subtle. You'll see little touches like a chef's hat, round nose and whiskers in a mirror or a little Remy worked into the gold scroll work on the plates. There are even Gs worked into the carpeting in honor of Gusteau, the original chef/restaurant owner in the movie.<BR>But the main star at Remy is the food, which is on a par with the Grand Floridian's premium restaurant, Victoria and Albert's, at Disney World. Unlike its land-based counterpart, Remy does not allow guests under age 18 (V &amp; A's cut-off is 10). That's a smart move, because a meal at Remy is more of a production number, with multiple courses spread out over two and a half to three hours that would leave even the most patient kid fidgeting. For adults, the wait simply means time for one course to settle and your gastronomic anticipation to build before you dive into the next one.<BR>The elegance is apparent from the moment you walk into the restaurant. Seatings are spaced out in increments that allow each table to get the full multi-course presentation. We were seated in the wine room, a lovely, peaceful little three-table nook, where I sat in front of a wine case with bottles that cost more than my car inside (the most expensive is $25,000).<BR>At Victoria and Albert's they have a table hook to hang your purse. At Remy, it gets its own stool. The table settings are lovely, the lighting is low, and French music plays in the background (sorry, no live harp like V &amp; A). It's a great romantic spot where parents sailing with kids can plop them in the clubs and enjoy some adult time.<BR>The meal starts off with a signature champagne drink, the Colette, named after one of the movie's characters. The champagne itself is a special vintage made exclusively for the Disney Dream, and the same bubbly that was used to toast the maiden voyage. Just add some fruit and other ingredients and voila, you have a lovely pre-dinner drink to toast with.<BR>Next there was a very small, fried square (I think it involved tomato) to whet your appetite. It's not actually one of the courses, just a little “snack,” and I suspect it's something that might change/rotate on different nights. You also choose from a selection of three breads; I got stuck on one that tasted like it contained truffle oil, while my husband rotated between the other two. I usually slather my bread in butter, but this was so good that disguising its taste with anything would have been an affront to its flavor.<BR>There are two different menus chef's menus, created by the two who were involved with Remy's development, so my husband and I each chose one to allow us to get a little taste of everything. There are other pre-set menu variations, or you can mix and match items.<BR>First off was ratatouille for both of us (of course), although this was a far cry from the simple French dish in the movie. It featured delicious finely chopped vegetables and olive oil ice cream. I happen to like really odd ice creams, and overall I loved this dish. It was light, fresh, and flavorful so it was a great way to kick off the meal. The ice cream was not sweet. Think of it more as a cold, creamy but solid sauce.<BR>Next up lobster two ways for me and bison for my husband. He pegged the bison as one of his favorite dishes of the entire meal, and I'll admit it was tasty and tender. Myself, out of the two lobster preparations, my favorite was the one in salad, served in a wine glass, which seemed to have almost a smoked taste. The bison meat, served medium rare, was delicious too; very tender and full of flavor without being “rangy.” If you like beef, you would probably enjoy it.<BR>My next course was several different preparations of tomatoes, from small ones on cheese to gazpacho (cold soup) to a glass of champagne-colored essence of tomato. Since I am a huge tomato and cheese lover, this was one of my top courses. My husband had lobster bisque, although it wasn't the traditional soup. Rather, there was lobster meat with the bisque used more like a generously applied sauce, although I could easily have eaten it as a soup as it was exquisite. He pegged that as one of his favorite courses.<BR>Next up, we both had seafood. There was turbot with gnocchi for me and sea bass for hubby, which was another of his favorites. I enjoyed it, too, but I was in love with my own entree, as the sauce was absolutely heavenly. You get extra on the side, and I used every bit. Turbot is a mild fish, but the sauce added a creamy taste and texture that turned it into a delight. The gnocchi were like little balls of heaven. I ate two out of the three and reluctantly left one for my spouse.<BR>At this point, we were getting full and there was still lots of food to go. I've read concerns online that Remy is overpriced for the amount of food you get or that the portions are too small so you won't be full. Anyone who believes that doesn't understand the fine dining concept. The portions have to be small because, with so many courses involved, you'd quickly lose your stamina with typical oversized amounts of food. You get enough to savor with each course and to hopefully leave you with enough appetite to enjoy the entire meal. The portions were actually a little bigger than I thought they would be so it was a struggle to make it to the end.<BR>My husband's next course was wagyu beef, while mine was pigeon pie in puff pastry. The latter might sound a bit scary, but I assure you it's not. The pigeon, in a light, flaky shell, had a lovely smoked flavor, with extra sauce on the side. It was more gastronomically interesting than the beef, which was a very premium cut but still a more standard fare than what I was eating. It was unlike chicken or turkey; the closest thing I can compare it to is duck, but even that isn't fully accurate. Alas, I could only down a few bites because I knew that more was coming and I had to reserve precious stomach space.<BR>Next was my favorite course in any fancy meal: the cheese plate, which is quite fitting for the Remy theme. I always order the chef's cheese selection when we dine at upscale Disney eateries like Jiko and Flying Fish, so I was in heaven when I saw the cheese cart at Remy. It featured a wide variety of options, with two goat cheeses and offerings running from mild to sharp, including one peppery type. You can select a few options or get a sampler with a little bit of everything. Both my husband and I went for the latter option. They were served with honey comb, which makes a nice complement. The cheese was one of my favorite courses, but that's true anytime I run into a truly good cheese array (goat and sheep cheese are my favorites). The most interesting was the peppered cheese, which indeed had a zip to it.<BR>Finally: dessert! My husband had the poached pair, while I had a selection of several chocolate offerings, including pieces with “Remy” embossed on them. And be prepared, as you will also be hit with a special array of creations by the pastry chefs on top of what comes with your meal. As delicious as the final course was (chocolate with real gold on top...mmmm), I was struggling to find room and wondering how I would drag myself back to my stateroom with the extra poundage I had surely gained.<BR>We did not do the wine pairings, which cost an extra $99 per person. That much wine would put me under the table, and my husband decided to get some by the glass. The somollier is more than happy to assist with matching up something that suits your taste, although even the glasses can be a bit pricey. My husband likes sweet wines, so he got a recommendation for a French wine that was sweet enough to drink for dessert, and he ended up having two glasses of that, which came to about $25 per glass with the automatic gratuity.<BR>I also received a rose, and later we received a card and small box of chocolates (as if we needed more food) as a follow-up to our visit.

Located at basement one surrounding the central fountain, it serves a variety of unique crepes (pronounced ‘krep’ and not ‘creeps’) and sinful desserts, suitable for those seeking a light meal.  <BR>Although the concept is open air, the dining area does not feel crowded or noisy, offering customers a chance to people-watch, or to be people-watched. With its warm lighting and contemporary décor, small groups of friends will find it enjoyable to share crepes or waffles right next to the water feature.  <BR>The Food <BR>My choice was the ‘Mega Menu’ which included a salad, savoury crepes, and a beverage ($20.00++). Crepes originate from France, but the menu here is modified to with international and local flavours which would appeal to those who love variety.  <BR>Some of the recommended crepes include Yum Yum Mushroom ($12.50) filled with sautéed shiitake, straw and oyster mushroom, Fish Masala ($15.50) inspired from Indian spices, Seafood Jungle ($15.50) packed with crabmeat, prawns and citrus fruits, Korean BBQ Pork ($12.50), and Beef and Bell Peppers ($13.50).  <BR>One of the best sellers is Peking Duck Crepe ($14.50) with thin whole wheat crepe wrapping around roasted duck with sambal olek, lychees and plum sauce. The result is an interesting union of dark salty-sweet sauce and roasted duck which is not too fatty. The lychees provide extra sweetness and juice to the combination, but are too few to make a significant difference.  <BR>The Green Garden Salad is a standard starter of seasonal greens with balsamic and olive oil. The Iced Tea is a surprisingly refreshing beverage which has a light fragrance and is not too sweet.  <BR>There are only two versions of the sweet crepes when compared to the savory choices. Opt for the Chocolate Mania ($11.50) of glazed banana wrapped in chocolate crepe with dark chocolate ice cream or the Strawberry Cream ($11.50) toped up with custard cream and vanilla ice cream. The succulent strawberries and light custard are sinfully unforgettable.  <BR>My main gripe about the food was that the portions are too small for the price to pay. Unless there is a promotion, the individual items added up will cost quite a bit up to $30 per person. Also, while it is enough for an after-meal dessert, customers who want a full meal may go hungry. <BR>The Service <BR>While the waiters serve with a smile at times, there are too few of them to go around. During peak hours, they are almost too busy to notice your requests.  <BR>The experience may be nothing divine, but Out of the Pan’s versions of crepes can be said to be creative and out of the box.

The great news is the only thing one has to do to become a good cook is know how to clearly follow a recipe. I happen to be a fan of Asian and Mediterranean dishes because of the strong uses of my favorite spices such as sesame and olive oils. These genres of food also seem to be the most nutritious in my opinion since Asians rarely eat dairy and Greeks use many herbs that usually promote good health. Here are a few recipes to try and I am sure that you will enjoy them as much as I do.<BR>Garlic-Teriyaki Pork Chops<BR>*4-6 pork chops (or however many individuals are being served)<BR>*10 fl. oz. bottle of Kikkoman garlic teriyaki marinade<BR>*A bundle of spring onion stalks/scallions<BR>*A bulb of garlic cloves or pre-minced garlic in a jar<BR>*Garlic salt, black pepper, onion powder<BR>*2 table spoons of sesame seed oil *2 table spoons of sesame seeds<BR>*1 lemon<BR>-Season raw pork chops with spices to your liking. Mix marinade and sesame oil together in a mixing bowl then place meat in refrigerated marinade overnight. Finely chop or mince spring onions/scallions and garlic. Once pork chops are done marinating, evenly distribute chopped garlic over the meat and then bake at 375 degrees for 1 hour(if one inch thick pork chops, 1 hour and 30 minutes if 2 inches thick). Once pork chops are done sprinkle onions/scallions and sesame seeds over the meat. Once this is done squeeze lemon over meat lightly then serve.<BR>Mandarin Plantains<BR>*2-3 ripe Plantains<BR>*1 cup mandarin orange juice<BR>*1/3 cup of cinnamon<BR>*1/3 cup of sugar<BR>*2 sticks of butter<BR>*1 tablespoon vegetable oil<BR>-Slice plantains into circular pieces. Place butter, sugar, cinnamon, and mandarin juice into oiled skillet over low heat until the butter has completely dissolved. Place plantains in skillet then turn up to medium heat. Fry plantains until golden brown on the outside with a soft center. When finished place them on a napkin to drain off excess oil, let cool off, then serve. <BR>Hearty Homemade Chicken Soup (for 4 servings)<BR>*6 cups of chicken broth<BR>*1 cup water<BR>*4 baked chicken breasts (5-6 ounces)<BR>*3 whole potatoes<BR>*1 1/2 table spoons of lemon pepper, seasoning salt, onion powder, and parsley flakes<BR>*1 1/2 teaspoons of butter<BR>*1 whole onion<BR>*1 green bell pepper<BR>-Cut baked chicken breasts into small to medium sized pieces. Cut potato, onion, and green pepper into quarter sized pieces. Put chicken broth, water, seasonings, and butter into a pot at a low temperature. Once butter dissolves add chicken and vegetables, bring to a low boil for half an hour, and stir every 5-6 minutes. Once vegetables are soft the soup is ready to serve.<BR>Rainbow Pasta Salad<BR>* 1 16 oz box of angel hair or linguini pasta<BR>*1 ripe tomato<BR>*1 large cucumber<BR>*1 whole onion<BR>*2 ounces of black olive halves<BR>*1 green onion<BR>*1 lemon<BR>*1 table spoon lemon pepper, seasoning salt, and McCormicks Salad Supreme seasoning<BR>*1 cup of Italian dressing<BR>*1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil<BR>-Boil pasta until tender, drain, and then run under cool water to prevent sticking. Finely chop vegetables and mix them all into a medley in a separate bowl. Refrigerate pasta until its completely chilled. Once pasta is cold season it with the spices, add extra virgin olive oil, and squeeze lemon over noodles. Add vegetables to seasoned pasta and then pour Italian dressing. Mix and Serve.

38	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com	HAVANA — Where some might see a rotten window frame pocked by termites, Julio César Hidalgo envisions a polished takeout counter, the rich smell of garlic and oregano wafting out onto a warm Havana street. <BR>In his mind’s eye, the coarsely laid concrete covering the surfaces of his shabby living room is already a gleaming white countertop laid with sandwiches, pastries, and balls of yeasty dough; a gas oven in the corner bakes mouthwatering pizza. <BR>After Cuban authorities announced last September that they were opening the island’s closed Marxist economy to a limited amount of private enterprise, Hidalgo was one of the first to line up for a new business license. <BR>Ever since, the 31-year-old baker has been transforming the front of his narrow apartment in a run-down section of Old Havana into a standup pizza joint and cafe. In a land of modest dreams, Hidalgo says his is simple: to be the master of his own labor. <BR>“It’s not going to make me rich,” he laughs, adding that he may make only a little more than he does now in a $12-a-month job at a state-run bakery. “But I’ll be working in my own home and I’ll be my own boss.’“ <BR>Hidalgo and tens of thousands like him are chasing their entrepreneurial ambitions in Cuba’s year of economic change, hopeful that a sweeping fiscal overhaul announced last year by President Raúl Castro is for real. The Cuban leader said the country would lay off half a million state workers by March 31, while granting licenses for a broad, if slightly random, array of businesses. <BR>The new entrepreneurs face towering challenges in getting their enterprises off the ground, including high taxes, a lack of raw materials, an uncertain customer base, labyrinthine bureaucratic rules and limited access to startup capital. Yet, their success or failure will go a long way in determining the future of Cuba’s revolution. <BR>The Cuban state now employs 84 percent of the island’s workers and controls 90 percent of the economy in one of the world’s last bastions of Soviet-style communism. If the free-market experiment works, the cash-strapped government could shed millions of dollars from its payroll while boosting much-needed tax revenues and creating a new business and consumer class. It could also legalize part of a booming black market that provides everything from sausages to satellite television. <BR>If the experiment fails, however, this already disillusioned and dysfunctional country will have turned hundreds of thousands of people out of their government jobs and into an uncertain future. All of this in the same year that Raúl Castro turns 80, and his older brother Fidel is widely expected to step down from his final official post as head of the Communist Party. <BR>Through Jan. 7, more than 75,000 people had received new licenses, joining about 143,000 private-sector workers left over from the island’s last dabble with capitalism. Government economists say they hope a quarter of a million new entrepreneurs will eventually sign up. <BR>Almost all the new businesses are small, operating out of homes or on street corners. But the stakes for Cuba couldn’t be higher, with the economy weighed down by crippling disorganization, a broken infrastructure, endemic corruption and an enormous labor force that has become accustomed to getting paid very little — and doing very little in return. <BR>Among the thousands who have taken the leap into private enterprise are Maria Regla Saldivar, a 52-year-old black belt in Taekwondo who plans to open a gymnasium in the ruins of a destroyed laundromat, and Javier Acosta, who has started an upscale restaurant catering to tourists. There is Danilo Pérez, a 21-year-old accountant who has gotten a license to buy and sell bootleg DVDs in Havana’s hardscrabble El Cerro neighborhood, and Anisia Cardenas, a seamstress with a license to make clothes. <BR>Many others are giving manicures, painting homes, fixing cars and driving taxis — services on the list of 178 officially sanctioned private activities. Some of the other opportunities are more obscure, such as fresh-fruit peeling. And some are so specific they refer to just two people, like No. 159, which makes it legal to be part of the Amor Dance Duo. <BR>Even the Cuban government — in an internal document to party leaders obtained by The Associated Press — warned that many of the businesses will fail within a year. And many Cubans say privately that they will wait and see if ventures such as Hidalgo’s prosper before jumping into the fray themselves. <BR>But for now, optimism and excitement reign among the new entrepreneurs. <BR>“We are going to be a success. I am sure of it,” says Gisselle de la Noval, 20, Hidalgo’s bright-faced girlfriend, who will work the till at the pizzeria and share in its profits. “This (economic) opening was marvelous. ... I think those who know how to take advantage of it will have a bright future.” <BR>A DISMAL STATE OF AFFAIRS <BR>Cuba’s push to open its economy to private enterprise does not indicate an ideological change of heart among its Communist leaders. It is based on necessity. <BR>The economy has been slammed by the global economic downturn, a drop in nickel prices and the fallout from three devastating hurricanes that hit in quick succession in 2008. Revenues from tobacco, rum and sugar have fallen, as have remittances from Cubans living overseas. <BR>Prevented from borrowing from international monetary institutions by the 48-year U.S. trade embargo, Cuba was forced to reduce food and other imports from its main trading partners by 37 percent. <BR>The economy grew by just 1.4 percent and 2.1 percent respectively in 2009 and 2010, a terrible performance for a small, developing country — and figures many economists dismiss as fantasy anyway, since Cuba counts state spending on social programs when calculating economic growth. <BR>Even state-run newspapers have been filled with stories of extraordinary inefficiency, with dozens of “watchmen” paid by the state to guard fallow fields, or 30 emergency workers at a hospital standing idle because all have been assigned to a single ambulance. <BR>“My fear is that the Cuban state is completely broke,” says Uva de Aragon, a Cuba expert at Florida International University, who is closely watching the free-enterprise experiment. “I don’t want to think about what will happen, even in the medium term, if it doesn’t work.” <BR>Shortages are everywhere: in the sparse shelves at state-run supermarkets; along the unlit city streets and empty, rutted highways; in the antiquated factories on the outskirts of cities and in the tractorless farms dotting the countryside, many still relying on oxen to till the earth. The country of 11.2 million people has the lowest Internet penetration in the Western Hemisphere. <BR>The state pays workers salaries of about $20 a month in return for free health care and education, and nearly free transportation, utilities and housing. At least a portion of every citizen’s food needs are sold to them through ration books at heavily subsidized prices. <BR>Getting by on those salaries is such a struggle that stealing from state-owned companies is endemic, a major perk of having a job, and a frightening loss for those about to be laid off. The thievery is also a huge cost to the government, one of the reasons the country finds itself in such dire economic straits. <BR>Since taking over from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006 — first temporarily, then permanently — Raúl Castro has been whittling away at the subsidies. <BR>In recent months he’s cut free workplace lunches, removed potatoes, peas, cigarettes, soap, detergent and toothpaste from the ration book, and suggested the whole system must eventually be scrapped. <BR>Just how bad things had gotten became apparent in September, with a red-letter headline in the Communist Party newspaper Granma that the state would lay off a tenth of the island’s work force, while opening up the private sector. Days later, authorities published the list of 178 activities in which new licenses would be issued. <BR>The list steers clear of activities that could present a threat to the state’s monopoly on most economic activity. There are no licenses for independent lawyers, bankers or engineers, nor for Cubans to work privately in strategic sectors such as mining or hotel management. <BR>Still, there is no overestimating the scope of the change. <BR>For the first time since the 1960s, Cubans will be able to hire employees. They may rent out their homes and cars more freely, and hope to one day get business loans from state banks. Raul Castro has even called a rare Communist Party Congress, scheduled for April 16-19, in which the reforms will be enshrined as the country’s only way forward. <BR>THE NEW ENTREPRENEURS <BR>Hidalgo is a round-faced man with a permanently amused look in his eyes. Unlike most Cubans, he has been down the free-enterprise road before — with disastrous results. <BR>Cuba last opened up to some private enterprise following the collapse of its Soviet benefactor in the 1990s, which ushered in an era of extreme hardship known as the “Special Period.” <BR>In 1997, a 17-year-old Hidalgo and an older cousin opened a pizza joint in the same dingy apartment, only to find it was impossible to buy the cheese, flour and tomato paste they needed in state-owned shops. <BR>They turned to the black market, and ran into trouble. <BR>“The inspectors would show up ... sometimes once a week, sometimes twice a week,” Hidalgo says. “They demanded receipts, and when I couldn’t provide them they confiscated everything. They forced us to close.” <BR>In those days, Fidel Castro described the reforms as a necessary evil and quickly scaled them back once the crisis had ebbed. From a high of 209,000 license holders for private enterprise in 1996, Cuba’s tiny entrepreneurial class had dropped by a third by 2010. <BR>Raúl Castro has vowed it will be different this time around, telling Parliament in December that “the life of the revolution is in the balance.” The government has pledged an initial investment of $130 million to purchase the raw materials new businesses will need, and Hidalgo pointed to a stack of unopened boxes of white tile he purchased for $8 a box in a state-owned shop. <BR>Still, the path to self-employment promises to be tough. <BR>Hidalgo has already invested $700 in the pizzeria, largely with a gift from a cousin in Atlanta. <BR>Given the price of ingredients, Hidalgo thinks he’ll have to charge upward of 20 pesos ($1) for a personal-size pizza with olives and oregano — a small fortune for anybody living strictly on a Cuban government wage. And he’s already got competition: Two neighbors on his rundown street have licenses to open cafes. <BR>The government has made it easier for Cubans to rent space to each other, but there is no retail property available for private citizens, and few would have rent money even if there was. Most people either must carve out part of their home, or come up with creative ideas to get around the real estate shortage. <BR>Saldivar, the martial arts black belt, beamed with excitement as she walked through the skeleton of a building that was once an industrial laundry in Havana’s Nuevo Vedado neighborhood. She is petitioning the government to turn over title to the property so she can transform it into a gymnasium, and meanwhile, is using a small park nearby to hold fitness classes. <BR>The building has no roof or walls, and the oil-stained concrete floor is littered with truck-sized pieces of rusted machinery, but Saldivar is not deterred. <BR>“I’ll fix it up,” she insists. Her bigger worry is that authorities have not included martial arts in the list of acceptable activities. Saldivar says she will either have to limit her classes to aerobics, or “inventar,” a Cuban specialty that roughly translates as “to improvise.” <BR>“I don’t plan to give Taekwondo classes,” she deadpans. “I’m teaching the kids ‘Quimbumbia’,” Saldivar’s word for a discipline remarkably similar to Taekwondo. <BR>CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD <BR>Another challenge facing the private sector is taxes, which can be as high as 50 percent, not including social security. Many prospective entrepreneurs say the taxes will make it difficult for new businesses to break even, and could also scare many people already making a living on the black market from becoming legit. <BR>One woman, who has legally rented out rooms in Havana’s trendy Vedado neighborhood since 1994 and describes herself as a strong supporter of the revolution, complained the new system significantly increases her taxes: She will pay double the current $108 per room, per month. <BR>“I’m thinking of turning in my license,” she says, asking that her name not be used for fear of attracting the attention of authorities. “What will be left for us after we pay the government?” <BR>The burden will not be as high for some, however. For cafes, gymnasiums and many other activities, business owners will pay a fixed monthly fee of somewhere between 100 and 350 pesos ($5-$17), plus social security and payroll taxes. <BR>At the end of the year, most will be asked to declare their income under oath and pay a percentage of the profits. But in a nearly all-cash economy, few are expected to give an honest account. <BR>Phil Peters, a specialist on the Cuban economy who is vice president of the Arlington, Virginia-based Lexington Institute, says the government must walk a thin line between zealously policing the private sector for tax dodgers and black marketeers, and sucking the life out of the economic opening before it gets off the ground. <BR>He says the government must make good on its pledge to create a system of wholesalers, and find a way to extend microcredits to small businesses. Eventually, employee-owned “cooperatives” could take over inefficient state enterprises. <BR>“If the government is serious about laying off half a million unproductive workers, then it has a very strong interest in making the entrepreneurial sector work,” Peters says. <BR>Already, there are signs that the other major prong of the reform effort — the layoffs — are going more slowly than anticipated. Four months after the cuts were announced, it is unclear how many people have actually lost their jobs. <BR>Midlevel managers told AP that workers commissions set up to decide who is expendable have been slow to hand over names. Cubans familiar with deliberations in several ministries and state-owned companies say leaders — including some Cabinet members — have been reluctant to shed thousands of their employees. <BR>“It is a difficult and dangerous process, particularly if it is not handled well, or if there is favoritism or corruption,” a worker on one of the commissions told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of losing her job. <BR>Perhaps the strongest warning that the reforms do not go far enough has come from two prominent economists at the state-run Center for Cuban Economic Studies. <BR>In a rare opinion piece published in a small Catholic magazine, Pavel Vidal Alejandro and Omar Everleny Perez warned that there are not enough approved free-market activities to absorb half a million laid-off state workers, and not enough white-collar jobs for an educated population. <BR>They said it was hard to imagine that illiquid state banks could make good on the government’s pledge to extend microcredits, and urged the state to reach out to foreign investors. <BR>On a small scale, such investment is already happening. Several entrepreneurs said they had received seed money from relatives overseas, most of them in the United States. A recent decision by the Obama administration that allows any American to send up to $2,000 a year to Cuba could make such loans easier. <BR>Even if these new businesses get off the ground, it remains to be seen whether they will have enough customers, with so many newly unemployed. But entrepreneurs such as Hidalgo are riding a wave of hope. <BR>Hidalgo waits as a van pulls up carrying a gas oven, a loan from his girlfriend’s mother. He says he expects to be open for business by the end of February, and plans to call the pizzeria “Baldoquin,” after his grandfather. After more than a decade fantasizing about his own business, Hidalgo says he can hardly contain himself. <BR>“Just imagine it!” he gushes, thinking of that first pizza out of the oven. “It will be the realization of a dream I have held onto forever.”

People in the USA eat about 16 billion quarts of popcorn each year. That's about 54 quarts per person. Popcorn is said to have been created in India and China more than 5,000 years ago, as a game where kernels were popped over sizzling hearths. The game consisted of trying to catch the kernels in mid-air. But only in the 1980s did popcorn become available in stores prepared for modern microwave ovens.<BR>What makes a quality popcorn? It's how much moisture is in its kernel. Food scientists sometimes even measure the expansion ratio of the kernel using math formulas. Chefs look at food processing procedures.<BR>Pocorn industry researchers study storage and handling at home as well as in transit and in the plant. It goes back to the genes in the corn kernel and whether the corn kernel is or is not genetically modified by scientists in the seed form or whether the corn is organic or full of pesticides while growing on the farm. So it's all a history of how our food is produced before it reaches your home. There's celebrated on January 31st of each year. And then there's National Popcorn Month, celebrated in October.

Put 1/4 of the popcorn in a large bowl. Sprinkle over the freshly popped, warm popcorn the feta and kasseri cheese, oregano, basil, and one-quarter of the jar filled with that extra virgin cold-pressed olive oil which you've marinated overnight with the curry powder, turmeric, black pepper, olives, and garlic. Repeat for the remaining quarters. By seasoning every quarter at a time, it keeps the wonderful curried seasoning taste through the whole batch of spicy popcorn. Instead of butter, you're using olive oil. If you don't like olive oil, you can substitute the olive oil for walnut oil, sesame seed oil, or macadamia nut oil. Some people like grape seed oil or rice bran oil. Choose the flavor of the oil you like most before you add the curry spices, garlic, and pepper to marinate the oil. �
41	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.independent.ie	The Irish love affair with the delicious, colourful, spicy food of the subcontinent continues apace with the opening of yet another Indian restaurant which, judging by our visit in its first week, is really rather good. <BR>This is Dakshin, over Kiely's pub in Donnybrook. Dakshin, Sanskrit for southern, reflects the southern-Indian heritage of the owner, Saji Mathew, the chef, Madhusudanan, and the food, which is contemporary in style. While it is the first venture of Saji Mathew on his own, he is very experienced, having been with the Jaipur Group for six years, working in Jaipur Dalkey, Chakra by Jaipur in Greystones and, most recently, in Ananda, Dundrum. Madhusudanan has worked in Rasam in Glasthule under Sanjay Vishwakarma, and in Ananda under Sunil Ghai. <BR>The space was occupied for many years by a Thai restaurant, which had become jaded and tired. Now completely revamped with a bright bar area at one end, the decor features massive lampshades made here in Dublin from sari fabric, and filigree screens, which create a comfortable, spacious dining area, as well as breaking it up. One side of the room comprises long banquette seating, with opposing tables, where we were seated, with window views of the main street, and groups of young girls in micro minis heading for a disco. No doubt they left home in different attire! <BR>To the food. I liked that the menu was not of the encyclopaedic, overwhelming variety, where you sometimes feel everything is precooked and then drowned in a wodge of heavy, Delhi-belly takeaway sauce. The nine starters (6.50-12.50) included kesari jhinga: saffron and lemon leaf-flavoured prawns, cooked in a tandoori oven, with watermelon and mint salsa, and onion and tomato chutney. Pan-seared scallops are served with upma -- a southern-Indian specialty of semolina and grilled spices -- and a green-pea fondue.<BR>I was drawn to their Dakshin Salad (7) which had balsamic-anointed rocket leaves, adorned with grilled Black Mission fig sections, crispy, fried strips of plantain, very finely crisped cubes of paneer cheese, peppers, and cherry tomatoes. I really liked its freshness and varying textures. Brendan's "lamb cutlet" (8.50) was, perhaps, a misnomer, as the dish comprised a brace of delicious minced-lamb patties oozing flavours of clove, curry leaf and ginger, with a little artistic stack of cucumber and carrot 'chips', which added a fresh contrast. Mains (15.50-21) included 11 dishes plus two thali selections -- vegetarian or meat and fish. The all-time favourite, chicken tikka masala is there, as is lamb rogan josh, kadai chicken and lamb biriyani. Sea bass has a classic Keralan gravy with glazed carrots and tossed asparagus with tomato rice, while simmered lamb shank is Goan style, with star anise and green chilli finished with cocum, an Indian fruit. Tandoori chicken (17) was substantial with breast and leg marinated with red chilli, garlic and yoghurt, and served with rice and a tomato-y tikka masala sauce. Mahsahari thali (21) looked great, with the rice shielded by a conical pyramid presentation of dosa flatbread, keeping it moist and warm. Four little accompanying dishes were chicken kozhi varutha, Keralan lamb, Alleppey prawn curry, and stuffed potato served with a spinach sauce. They contrasted well, the prawn curry had a lovely, fruity sauce of raw mango, green chilli, ginger and coconut milk, while the lamb was rich and deep.<BR>I finished with home-made kulfi (6) -- an eggless ice-cream, which is always a favourite of mine -- cooling and light. We also had a bottle of Austrian Sepp Gruner Veltliner 2009 (24.50) and a coffee (2.50) bringing our bill to 94.50 with optional service. 22-24 Donnybrook Road, Dublin 4.<BR>Tel: (01) 202-8182
42	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.independent.ie	A good, juicy orange feels heavy in the hand. These balls of sunshine can add so much fun and flavour to your cooking, quite apart from the joy of simply eating the fruit by itself. They're in season at the moment, so it's the best time to use them in recipes, although, like everyone else, I use them all year round in so many ways.<BR>Freshly squeezed orange juice mixed into a yogurt is just delicious poured over your breakfast cereal. When making a coleslaw, I like to thin the mayonnaise to a runny consistency by mixing some freshly squeezed orange juice into it. <BR>A delightfully simple but tasty sauce can be made in the following way with four fresh oranges. Squeeze the juice from two of the oranges and add enough water to the juice to measure a total of 300ml (?pt). Stir the liquid into 2-3 rounded teaspoons of cornflour and add 75g (3oz) caster sugar. Bring it to the boil, stirring all the time to thicken slightly. <BR>Cut the remaining two oranges into individual segments and, ensuring all the white pith has been removed, add them to the sauce. Finally add a tablespoon or two of freshly squeezed lemon juice to give a kick to the flavour. This sauce is delicious served hot on ice cream or with pancakes. <BR>CARROT, TOMATO AND ORANGE SOUP <BR>At this time of year, a tin of tomatoes will give a much better result than fresh ones, and a tin of plum tomatoes will be richer in texture than the standard chopped tomatoes. <BR>You will need: <BR>40g (1 1/2oz) butter <BR>1 tablespoon olive oil or sunflower oil <BR>1 medium onion, chopped <BR>450g (1lb) carrots, chopped <BR>150g (5oz) potatoes, peeled and chopped <BR>2 sticks celery, finely chopped <BR>Salt and freshly ground black pepper <BR>1 teaspoon sugar <BR>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin <BR>900ml (1 1/2pt) chicken stock <BR>1 x 400g (14oz) tin chopped plum tomatoes <BR>Orange juice, squeezed from 2 oranges, use a third if necessary <BR>3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives <BR>200ml creme fraiche <BR>Put the butter and the olive or sunflower oil, whichever you are using, into a heavy-based saucepan, then add the chopped onion and fry it lightly without browning it. Add the chopped carrots and potatoes and the finely chopped celery. Season them with some salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the sugar and cook very gently over a low heat with the lid on to sweat the vegetables for about five minutes. Stir them occasionally. <BR>Next, stir in the ground cumin, the chicken stock and the tin of chopped plum tomatoes. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and cover the saucepan with a lid. Cook until the vegetables are tender, which should take about 20-30 minutes. If you like, buzz the soup in a blender or a food processor, or simply mash the cooked vegetables gently with a potato masher, and then return the soup to the saucepan. <BR>Add the freshly squeezed orange juice to the soup and reheat. Taste and, if necessary, add more salt and freshly ground black pepper or sugar. Stir in two tablespoons of the chopped chives and, if you like, some of the creme fraiche. Otherwise, serve the creme fraiche separately. To serve, sprinkle a little of the chopped chives over each bowl of soup. A handy meal with a tasty combination of flavours. Serves 4. <BR>You will need: <BR>4 chicken breasts, preferably partially boned <BR>1 medium lemon <BR>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped <BR>2 tablespoons clear honey <BR>1 tablespoon olive oil <BR>1 heaped teaspoon wholegrain mustard <BR>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme <BR>Finely grated zest and juice of 1 medium orange <BR>Salt and freshly ground black pepper <BR>Preheat the oven to 200 C, 400 F, Gas 6. <BR>Cut three slits across the top of each chicken breast and lay them in a shallow, ovenproof dish. Cut the lemon in half, cut one half into wedges and place them around the chicken breasts. Squeeze the other lemon half and mix the juice with the finely chopped garlic, the clear honey, the olive oil, the wholegrain mustard and the fresh thyme leaves, or the dried thyme, whichever you're using. Add a little bit of finely grated orange zest also and spoon this mixture on to the chicken breasts. Season with some salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cover with tin foil. Bake for 20-30 minutes (a little longer if the breasts are partially boned) or until the chicken appears cooked through. Remove the tin foil and continue cooking the breasts uncovered so that the top of them browns nicely. When the breasts are cooked, lift them out. Add the orange juice to the juices in the cooking dish. Taste and, if necessary, add more salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon the juices over the chicken and serve. <BR>PORK CHOPs WITH TANGY ORANGE SAUCE <BR>Fresh orange juice mixed with grated fresh ginger and tiny cardamom seeds makes a very tasty sauce in which to cook pork chops. The pork chops are first lightly browned on a pan and then placed in a single layer in an ovenproof dish. They are then covered with this tasty sauce and cooked in the oven. This dish takes a generous hour to cook. <BR>You will need: <BR>4-6 lean pork chops <BR>2-3 tablespoons olive or sunflower oil <BR>Salt and freshly ground black pepper <BR>1 large onion, thinly sliced <BR>1 small garlic clove, chopped <BR>Juice of 2 large oranges <BR>400-600ml (3/4-1pt) chicken stock <BR>2 teaspoons very finely grated fresh root ginger <BR>Little black seeds from 6-8 cardamom pods <BR>2 dessertspoons mango chutney <BR>1 rounded tablespoon cornflour, blended with a little cold water <BR>1-3 tablespoons fresh cream <BR>Chopped fresh parsley, to sprinkle on top <BR>Mashed potato, to serve <BR>Green vegetable of your choice, to serve <BR>Preheat the oven to 180 C, 350 F, Gas 4. <BR>Fry the lean pork chops in the olive or sunflower oil, whichever you are using, until they are golden on each side, and arrange them in a single layer in an ovenproof dish. Season with some salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry the thinly sliced onion and chopped garlic until they become soft and then scatter them over the chops. Mix together the orange juice, the chicken stock, the very finely grated fresh root ginger, the black cardamom seeds and the mango chutney. Pour this sauce over the chops. Cover tightly with a lid or with some tin foil. Bake in the oven for 1-1? hours until the chops are very tender. Then pour the juices into a saucepan, add the blended cornflour and bring to the boil to thicken a little, and so that the juices lose their watery texture. If necessary, use a little more cornflour. Stir in the fresh cream and pour the mixture back over the chops. Sprinkle with the chopped fresh parsley. Serve with mashed potatoes and a green vegetable. <BR>ALMOND FEATHER SPONGE WITH FRESH ORANGE DRIZZLE <BR>Simple to make, this single-layer cake has sweetened fresh orange juice, with a little lemon juice added for bite, drizzled over the top to give a lovely moist sponge. The lemon juice could be substituted with a generous dash of brandy -- if the humour takes you. <BR>You will need: <BR>175g (6oz) butter <BR>175g (6oz) caster sugar <BR>3 large eggs <BR>150g (5oz) self-raising flour <BR>Finely grated rind of 1/2 lemon <BR>1/2 teaspoon almond extract <BR>75g (3oz) ground almonds <BR>25g (1oz) flaked almonds <BR>Juice of 1 1/2-2 oranges <BR>Juice of 1/2 lemon <BR>25-40g (1-1?oz) caster sugar <BR>Whipped cream or sour cream, to serve <BR>Use a deepish sandwich tin, 23cm (9in) in diameter. Grease it with butter and line the base with a circle of baking parchment. Preheat the oven to 190 C, 375 F, Gas 5. <BR>Beat the butter until it is soft and add the caster sugar. Beat together until soft. Beat in the eggs one at a time, adding a spoon of the weighed self-raising flour with the third egg if the mixture gets rather curdled in appearance. Beat in the finely grated lemon rind and the almond extract. Then stir in the rest of the flour and the ground almonds to make a smooth mixture. Put into the tin and spread out. Scatter the flaked almonds over the top. Bake for about 35 minutes until golden brown and cooked through. <BR>While the cake bakes, mix together the orange juice, the lemon juice and the caster sugar, stirring well. The mixture should measure about 150ml (?pt). Taste when you're adding the lemon juice to ensure the resulting drizzle is not too bitter. The sugar will dissolve while the drizzle is standing. <BR>Cool the sponge in the tin on a wire tray for a few minutes and then turn out to cool completely. Remove the paper lining from the base and put on a serving plate. Using a skewer, pierce a lot of holes in the surface of the cake and gently spoon the drizzle all over the surface. Serve with whipped cream or sour cream.
43	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.xpatathens.com	The restaurant serves extremely fresh, innovative seafood dishes at affordable prices. Reliable dinners include grilled sea bass or shrimp in tomato and pepper sauce. Adventurous diners should try mussels stuffed with rice, grapes, and pine nuts; cuttlefish stew with broccoli and cream; or lobster with lemon, honey, and balsamic vinegar. Fresh salads and vegetable fritters accompany meals, and a simple but excellent wine list promises terrific vintages. Smart-casual to dressy attire. Reservations necessary. I have my all-time favorites and Kollias taverna is definitely one of them. I think it’s one of the few destination restaurants that have bucked the trend, lasting and thriving in an area that defies the dictum “location is everything.” <BR>Years can go by between visits, as was the case with a friend of mine recently, but he recalled her name and the dish she ate the last time she was there! Software geniuses have designed computer programs that do that! For Tasso it’s part of being a good restaurateur. The place hasn’t changed much over the years. It’s live in, filled to the brim with fishing and maritime trinkets. His kitchen is open to the public and always bustling, but a visit to the fridge to see the catch of the day—always directly from fishermen and not from the Ichtyoscala (the wholesale market where the fishing boats come in every morning)—is a must. We love the fact that here we found a whole range of great Lenten fare, including: soupia Yiouvetsi (cuttlefish and pasta) with its ink, eggplant rolls filled with mussels, octopus Stifado (stew). Seskoulodolmades with pligouri (chard dolmas filled with bulgur), and stuffed kolokytholoulouda (zucchini blossoms). Don’t miss the pitaroudia (fried patties) filled with Tarama either. Small fish from the Aitoliko Gulf off western Greece, such as “hovioi” are in season now and Tasso is quick to tell you that the bigger size is called “Papoutsia” ("shoes") by local fishermen. We loved his fried small soupies in their ink and the classic but delicious fish baked in salt. It’s not easy in these tough times to keep a place going for so long. Kollia’s recipe for excellent food, fresh greek fish, the best wine prices in town and hospitality that’s really heartfelt has made this place top of my own list of personal favorites. <BR>Hours: <BR>Alcohol Served: Beer, Wine <BR>Ambiance: Intimate, Outdoor Dining <BR>Cuisine: European, Greek <BR>Dress: Business Casual <BR>Meals: Dinner <BR>Reservations: Absolutely Required <BR>Contact: +30 210 462 9620 /210 94 08 620 <BR>NOTE: Kollias seafood restaurant has changed location and is now in Syngrou AVenue, close to Metropolitan hotel - fantastic food and very good prices and good atmosphere
44	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.troymedia.com	EDMONTON, AB, Jan. 30, 2011/ Troy Media/ – The middle 2000s have generally not been that favourable to cattle and calf producers in Alberta, with prices moving sideways and rising input costs and a loonie near parity eroding profit margins. But recently, beef and pork prices have show some signs of life and, according to futures prices on the Chicago exchange, cattle prices are up 24 per cent from a year ago. <BR>This recent jump in prices stems largely from the fact that the U.S. cattle herd has dropped dramatically in size. Official figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are due out Friday afternoon, but a survey of analysts predicts that the herd has fallen to its lowest level in 53 years. Both soybean meal and corn are major feeding expenses for farmers and the rapid rise in their costs has provided incentives for ranchers to cull their herds. <BR>The situation in Alberta has followed a similar path with the total cattle herd falling to 5.15 million in 2010 from 5.93 million in 2005. Moving forward, the rise in prices may provide a bit of reprieve for Alberta cattle producers but with the Canadian dollar stuck around parity and increasing international competition still a factor, the outlook remains somewhat mixed. <BR>U.S. dollar depreciation and agricultural prices <BR>Agriculture Canada released a paper on the impacts a depreciating U.S. dollar can have on agricultural markets. Using an OECD model the researchers estimated what a further depreciation in the U.S. dollar would have on agricultural prices. <BR>Most agricultural commodities are priced in U.S. dollars. An appreciation in a foreign currency makes the price relatively cheaper for importers, stoking demand and putting upward pressure on the U.S. dollar denominated price. American farmers will likely benefit the most from the situation, as they will see their relative competitiveness increase on world markets at higher prices. <BR>According to the simulation, Canada would see pork and beef production decline, as American production becomes increasingly competitive. The reduction in livestock herds leads to less demand for cereal and oil seed, leading to increased wheat seeding. <BR>| Will Van’t Veld, ATB Financial

But there are simple guidelines. No need to starve or skip meals. In fact, an empty stomach will lead to all sorts of complications like acidity, ulcers, low blood sugar, migraines and irritability. Food, when taken in moderate amounts three to five times a day, assures you of gradual weight loss.<BR>In order to lose weight, stick to fruits and vegetables that rank low on the glycemic index. For example, did you know that watermelon is high on the glycemic index, simply because it is so naturally sweet? But that doesn't mean that we should never eat watermelon.<BR>As a nutritional fruit, it is low in carbohydrates and high in water, and contains lycopene, a carotenoid that has anti-inflammatory power (others are tomato, red grapefruit and guava). But there is a way to eat anything we want, minus the potato, which is quickly converted into sugar. Here are some practical tips.<BR>What not to eat <BR>Eat your protein before anything sweet, or mix your high-glycemic food with vegetables.<BR>Dried fruits (raisins, prunes, figs, dates) are high in anti-inflammatory fiber and anti-oxidants. However, they are high in sugar and calories. You may, however, mix it with oatmeal or yogurt.<BR>Avoid baked goods, rolls, bread, cake, candy, cereals (except old-fashioned oatmeal), soft cheese (stick to hard cheese), muffins, corn syrup, donuts, fast food, French fries, granola, jams, jellies, popcorn, potatoes, snack foods, sodas, sugar, vegetable oils (except virgin olive oil and virgin coconut oil), pasta and noodles (unless multi-grain).<BR>Sweeteners: no chemical sweeteners like Splenda (also known as sucralose), saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame K, xylitol.<BR>What to eat <BR>Fruits and vegetables, apples, arugula, asparagus, avocado, blueberries, strawberries, green beans, all dark green leafy vegetables, eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower.<BR>Dairy-organic eggs, low-fat cottage cheese.<BR>Nuts: organic almonds, walnuts, flaxseed, macadamia, pecans, spinach, squash, tomatoes, turnips, mushrooms, peppers<BR>Omega-3 seafood: mackerel, sardines, anchovies, salmon, halibut, any white fish, trout, herring, sea bass, shellfish<BR>Poultry: organic chicken and turkey, Cornish hen, turkey sausage and bacon (minus nitrates)<BR>Sweeteners: A safe sweetener is Stevia, a non-caloric herb from Paraguay that is a natural food. It is one of the safest alternatives to conventional and chemical sweeteners. Coconut sugar also ranks low on the glycemic index and is safe for diabetics.<BR>Editor's note: There are also foods that can help you burn fat due to their thermogenic properties. Check them out here <BR>Burn your sugar <BR>It seems like everything we eat turns to sugar. And in some food preparations, sugar is added to sweeten the dish. You should be aware of these hidden sugars. But whatever you eat, always remember that exercise will burn the calories that sugar brings.<BR>Remember: Eat less but more often, exercise daily, drink generous amounts of water, and adopt a cheerful attitude in life.

21	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.krgv.com	Although protein is one of the most important nutrients, most people misunderstand how to get it and what is the right amount to maintain good health. Surprisingly, an average American takes in as much as three times the necessary amount. is a necessary part of any diet because it contains amino acids that repair body cells and tissues. Since the nine essential amino acids needed cannot be produced by the body, they must be supplied by diet. Foods that contain all the essential amino acids are considered complete proteins. Foods that contain complete proteins are meats, fish, poultry, and dairy products. Although red meat is very protein-rich, keep in mind that it contains large amounts of saturated fat. Most vegetables and grains are considered incomplete proteins because, when eaten by themselves, they provide less than adequate amounts of the necessary amino acids. However, since vegetables and grains contain different amounts and proportions of essential amino acids, they can be combined to complement each other to provide complete protein. An example of this would be rice and beans. In general, vegetable sources of protein will be complementary if you combine legumes (LEG-oomes) such as peas and lentils with grain products like wheat, corn, rice, or oats. Legumes can also be combined with nuts and seeds, such as almonds, cashews, and sesame seeds in order to provide a complete source of protein. Also, even though your activity level may decrease with age, your body's need for protein may increase at various times due to illnesses or various stresses in your life.

24	Karla Erovick, SF Romance Travel Examiner	2011-01-30	http://www.examiner.com	Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) celebrated 20 years of outstanding Zinfandel production in San Francisco this week. For Zinfandel lovers this was the place to be to enjoy Zinfandels from numerous wine regions throughout California. <BR>Festivities kicked off on Thursday with Good Eats and Zinfandel Pairing at Fort Mason. Guests were encouraged to sample food and Zinfandel pairings from their favorite wineries. Creative pairings by restaurants played up the Zinfandel flavor served alongside wineries. Fort Mason was decorated in a wine theme with larger than life grape clusters suspended from the ceiling. <BR>Food was perfectly paired with just the right Zinfandel to complement both the food and the wine. Small bites ranged from vegetable dishes, entrees with meat and fowl, and desserts. For foodies, the sushi grade fish, duck, Kobe Beef, lamb, and pork were worth savoring. With over 50 participating wineries in collaboration with 50 restaurants, it was impossible to leave the event hungry. <BR>To round out the food entertainment, there was a series of cooking demonstrations in the ZinKitchen utilizing Zinfandel and providing food and wine samples to observers. Mediterranean cuisine is well suited to Zinfandel as evidenced by Moroccan Meatball Tagine with lamb meatballs in tomato sauce served over cous-cous by Joyce Goldstein paired with Heritage Zinfandel. Sommelier Journal's Randy Caparoso hosted the cooking events in the ZinKitchen and ensured that guests were well supplied with Zinfandel. <BR>On Saturday the Grand Tasting drew crowds throughout the Bay Area and the world to sample some of California's most celebrated Zinfandels. There were so many wineries participating that they were scattered throughout two buildings, arranged alphabetically. The ZAP Guide listed particpating wineries by region, so one could easily visit an unfamiliar appellation or their favorite wineries. With over two hundres wineries to select from it required a strategy to choose the ones to sample. The ZAP Guide listed Wines by Appellation, Old Vines, Organic producers, Single Vineyards, Multi-generation Wineries, Wines by price-point, and Zinfandel Blends. We choose to visit recent Medal winners from the Chronicle Wine Competition. <BR>Many of the wineries represented were pouring their award-winning wines from recent wine competitions including Best of Class and Double Gold Awards. This was an opportunity to talk with the wine-makers, owner's and growers about their wines. While there are those who associate Zinfandel with jammy fruity wine, they would have been surprised to taste the variety of styles at ZAP. Guests were given their own souvenir wine glass and a 12-inch baguette to nosh on with an assortment of cheeses along with plenty of Zinfandel. <BR>if you missed ZAP this year, be sure to mark your calendar for next year's event held end of January 2012. For a listing of all of ZAP events this year, click here. <BR>ZAP is a non-profit organization with the mission to study and celebrate the Zinfandel grape, connect with one another, and educate the public about Zinfandel’s place in America’s history and culture. The Zinfandel Heritage Vineyard Project has been a fruitful collaboration with the primary goal to provide superior Zinfandel selections to growers as the basis for future plantings. The Silent Auction featured over 90 lots to raise money to fund ZAP's Heritage Projects.

10	Guest Writer	2011-01-30	http://biztech.caledonianmercury.com	Picture: Phillip Capper <BR>By John Knox <BR>In the precarious world of Scottish agriculture, 2010 will go down as a “not bad” year. Official estimates just out show that total income from farming increased last year by 18 per cent in real terms to £618m. <BR>The astonishing thing is that most of that is made up of subsidies from the tax-payer, £597m. Which means that the money we pay in the shops for our food is no where near the cost of production. <BR>The National Farmers Union says: “These figures show that the support farming receives from the European Common Agriculture Policy remains essential for the survival and well being of farm businesses in Scotland.” <BR>Its policy director Scott Walker says the next round of negotiations in Europe must make sure that CAP is properly funded and that the support goes to individual farms to enable them to continue producing home-grown food and preserve the countryside. <BR>The graph of Scottish farm income over the last 30 years looks like the outline of the Himalayas with huge peaks and deep valleys but the long-term trend is inexorably downwards. In 2009, total farm income fell by 15 per cent. There was a big dip in 1998, another dip in 1985 and again in 1980. It’s all a long way from the halcyon days of the early 1970s when total farm income in real terms was over £1.2 billion. Farmers do better in times of inflation. <BR>Even in the good year of 2010, average farm income was down 12 per cent at £34,400. This is the return made by the average farm to the farmer and his family, for their labour, and for the capital invested in the business: seeds, fertiliser, livestock, machinery, land and buildings. <BR>It’s not a lot and the fact that the average is falling when the total is increasing, means many poorer farms are struggling to survive. Not much wonder we saw farmers protesting about the low price of milk just before Christmas. They say they are only getting 25p a litre for their milk, while it is selling in the supermarkets for 62p. Either the big stores are making a huge profit or they are not charging enough for their milk. The cost of production, the farmers say, is 28p a litre. That’s why over 50 dairy farmers left the business last year. There are hardly a thousand left. <BR>Dairy farmers and fruit farmers have suffered the worst in the last year while cereal and livestock farmers have benefited from higher prices and the lower cost of fertilizers. <BR>In farming, there are so many variables – the weather, the global prices of wheat, barley, oats, lamb, beef, milk, fruit, vegetables, fertilizer, oil – none of which the individual farmer has any control over. Yet he or she must sow seed or buy young livestock or invest in new machinery or buildings or fencing or drainage in the hope that there is a profit at the end of the season. And the sums of money involved are huge. A tractor for instance costs around £60,000. These are risks few city-dwellers would be prepared to take. You have to be brought up in a long tradition of faith in the future. <BR>Farmers’ leaders increasingly take a global perspective. In reaction to last week’s UK government’s Foresight report on global food and farming futures, the NFU said: “The reality is that Scottish farmers are already delivering on the report’s central theme of sustainable intensification of farming.” The report talks of the need to feed a world population of 9 billion by 2050 and at the same time to combat climate change. The NFU warns that difficult decisions lie ahead on the “dysfunctional nature of our supply chain” and on the public’s reluctance to embrace new technology such as genetic modification. <BR>I went along to the new Agriculture Centre in Stirling to see a part of the supply chain for myself. In one sale ring, 837 cattle were sold in a rattling chant from the auctioneer and the slightest of nods from farmers leaning against the ringside. And in a second ring, by coincidence I presume, 837 sheep were sold. <BR>To the outsider, it’s all a mystery, numbers like £900 for the cattle and £60 for the sheep flew through the air. Men with prodding sticks guided the leaping animals into and out of the ring from the silver pens behind. Trucks and trailers stood ready to collect the animals at the side of the building later. And farmers in thick jerseys chatted in the bare-walled café and settled their bills at the auctioneer’s counter. <BR>It all seems a world away from the hallowed halls of the supermarkets with their fancy packaging and low prices. Yet the two worlds are in reality one. We push our trolleys full of groceries towards the check-out with hardly a thought for the farmer in his field and the global forces with which he has to contend. <BR>Related posts: Pampered pets’ vets blamed for food safety risk Snow and ash bury EasyJet in £78m half-year loss Children of the revolution

One very important tradition is the long table banquet. Reporter Xue Jingmeng brings you a taste of the typical Miao feast. <BR>This usually quiet village in Guizhou province is bustling ahead of the Chinese New Year. <BR>Lao Tang is famous in his hometown. In the 1970s, he went to Beijing to study at Minzu University of China. To promote the Miao culture of his village, he stayed on to work in Beijing for 7 years. He says he went home every year during that time. And families would always prepare a sumptuous long table banquet. <BR>These days, temperatures are below freezing in Guizhou. After buying all the banquet ingredients, Lao Tang took us to this fishpond. He told us that fresh fish cooked with typical spices is delicious. <BR>Xue said, “Lao Tang is preparing a very special meal. He’s bought pork and chicken from the market and caught the fish himself. He wants to make the finest feast for his hard-working family.” <BR>Around 4 o’clock in the afternoon, long table banquet begins. Lao Tang is the chef. <BR>Lao Tang said, “For the people of the Miao minority, over the New Year, we eat chicken, fish and preserved ham. The chicken porridge is necessary, one of our traditional dishes. Everyone likes it very much. For Spring Festival, we gather together, and eat well and drink well.” <BR>Lao Tang is retired, and prepares the banquet every year for his family. <BR>The family lives in this wood house, which is over a hundred years old. They don’t have a lot, but they’re happy. With planting season over, Lao Tang and his wife devote all their time to their grandchildren. <BR>Tang Shengzhang, son of Lao Tang, said, “I work in the county. I come back every weekend. My child is here and I’m excited to see her. It’s hard for parents to look after the children. Spring Festival is coming, I want to return as soon as possible, to see if everything is well prepared, and what else I can do.” <BR>The long table banquet is ready. Rice wine, hot-pot, chicken porridge are all on the table. There is a tradition in the Miao village. Over the New Year, all the relatives and friends come to eat and drink together. If you wish to come, no problem. <BR>Xue said, “For thousands of people in this village, a long table banquet is an important tradition and connection. People working away from home return and wish for a bumper harvest and success in the New Year.

16	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.kimt.com	Although protein is one of the most important nutrients, most people misunderstand how to get it and what is the right amount to maintain good health. Surprisingly, an average American takes in as much as three times the necessary amount. is a necessary part of any diet because it contains amino acids that repair body cells and tissues. Since the nine essential amino acids needed cannot be produced by the body, they must be supplied by diet. Foods that contain all the essential amino acids are considered complete proteins. Foods that contain complete proteins are meats, fish, poultry, and dairy products. Although red meat is very protein-rich, keep in mind that it contains large amounts of saturated fat. Most vegetables and grains are considered incomplete proteins because, when eaten by themselves, they provide less than adequate amounts of the necessary amino acids. However, since vegetables and grains contain different amounts and proportions of essential amino acids, they can be combined to complement each other to provide complete protein. An example of this would be rice and beans. In general, vegetable sources of protein will be complementary if you combine legumes (LEG-oomes) such as peas and lentils with grain products like wheat, corn, rice, or oats. Legumes can also be combined with nuts and seeds, such as almonds, cashews, and sesame seeds in order to provide a complete source of protein. Also, even though your activity level may decrease with age, your body's need for protein may increase at various times due to illnesses or various stresses in your life.

28	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.qdnd.vn	Vietnamese products are conquering domestic customers with their high quality, good designs and reasonable prices. <BR>The traditional Lunar New Year is coming soon and commercial centres, supermarkets and shops are full of Tet essentials. Of these Vietnamese products account for 85-90 percent. <BR>At supermarkets, like Big C, Fivimart, Metro and Intemex, many products such as confectionary, beverages and gift baskets with brand names of Bibica, Kinh Do, Pham Nguyen, Huu Nghi and Hai Ha are displayed in large quality. They are busy with customers from early morning to late night. Especially for Tet Big C chains have prepared around 100 tonnes of cold meat, 130 tonnes of confectionary, 500 tonnes of fruit and vegetables. In addition to traditional food, such as Chung cake, rice cake, Big C also provides specialities from different regions. <BR>Nguyen Trong Tan, Director of Big C Thang Long says consumption power during Tet increases by 20-30 percent, so the supermarket has prepared a large supply of goods for pre and after Tet. They promise not to raise prices. <BR>Earnings from Vietnamese goods accounted for 80-90 of total earnings, Tuan says. Big C regularly updates this information with its partners and producers. 95 percent of goods at the supermarket are Vietnamese products which were a wide range of models and samples. <BR>Following its slogan “Hapro brings spring to every family, the Hanoi Trade Corporation (Hapro) prepared a wide range of high quality products. It has worked with Hanoi districts to organise nine fairs on January 25-29. <BR>Mai Khue Anh, Hapro Managing Director, says that Hapro offers many traditional products at reasonable prices, such as Chung cakes, beef and pork pies, seafood spring rolls, Thang Long wine, Hanoi confectionary and beer, clothes and other essential products. <BR>Mai Anh says Hapro organised nine fairs in Hanoi’s outskirt districts both to provide rural customers with high quality products at reasonable prices and to stabilise the prices. <BR>The bustling atmosphere of shopping becomes most intense just before Tet. People look for good quality products and most of these are made domestically. <BR>“Vietnamese products offered at supermarkets and shops are diverse and their prices reasonable. Their quality is good and their designs are attractive,“ says Nguyen Thi Dieu, a customer from Long Bien district, Hanoi who shops at Fivimark. Vietnamese products can compete with imported ones. <BR>At Tet fairs, Vietnamese products are conquering domestic customers with their high quality, good design and reasonable prices. <BR>The “Vietnamese people use Vietnamese products” campaign launched by Politburo has brought practical benefit as it encourages domestic businesses to improve their technological capacity, expand their markets and meet the increasing demand of customers.

47	\N	2011-01-30	http://www.mnn.com	Animal rights org throws tongue-in-cheek support behind Taco Bell's recent recipe woes. <BR>Flickr/Creative Commons/vegandotcom <BR>The New Year hasn't started out so well for Taco Bell. <BR>The fast food chain found itself in the middle of a PR hurricane earlier this week after a lawsuit was filed alleging that the restaurant's beef is more than 65 percent filler. <BR>Take away the 35% beef and you're left with ingredients like "water, wheat oats, soy lecithin, maltodrextrin, anti-dusting agent and modified corn starch," according to a report from the Associated Press. <BR>The media pounced, customers balked, and the company took to newspapers and Youtube in an effort to denounce the claims and repair its battled image. <BR>Out of all this mess, however, Taco Bell can now count on support from a most unlikely ally: PETA. <BR>The animal rights org went online to congratulate the company's decision to use less meat in its products; saying that since their so-called "beef tacos" are already most vegan -- why not go all the way? “One hundred percent cruelty-free” has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?,” quipped PETA blogger Michelle Sherrow. <BR>“There’s just no reason for continuing the senseless slaughter of earth’s first and most vital creatures,” said another PETA exec. “And Taco Bell’s heroic step forward in refusing to use meat in its foods is commendable.” <BR>So congrats, Taco Bell. Your semi-meaty recipe sure is creepy, but it's nice knowing it's more animal-friendly than previously thought. Sure, you'll deride this lawsuit, and probably come out with some kind of 120% meat taco as a rebound, but in the end this is a real win for the public because it makes them think: Should I really be eating this thing with all these other things in it?
